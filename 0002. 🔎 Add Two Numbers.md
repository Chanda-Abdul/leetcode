# 2. ðŸ”Ž Add Two Numbers
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

You are given two <b>non-empty</b> linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in <b>reverse order</b>, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)
````
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
````

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Solution
### Approach 1: Elementary Math
#### Intuition

Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

<i>Figure 1. Visualization of the addition of two numbers: `342 + 465 = 807`.
Each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order.</i>

#### Algorithm

Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of `l1` and `l2`. Since each digit is in the range of `0â€¦9`, summing two digits may "overflow". For example `5 + 7 = 12`. In this case, we set the current digit to `2` and bring over the `carry = 1` to the next iteration. `carry` must be either `0` or `1` because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is `9 + 9 + 1 = 19`.

The pseudocode is as following:

- Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
- Initialize `carry` to `0`.
- Initialize `p` and `q` to head of `l1` and `l2` respectively.
- Loop through lists `l1` and `l2` until you reach both ends.
- Set `x` to node `p`'s value. If `p` has reached the end of `l1`, set to `0`.
- Set `y` to node `q`'s value. If `q` has reached the end of `l2`, set to `0`.
- Set `sum = x + y + carry`.
- Update `carry = sum / 10`.
- Create a new node with the digit value of `sum % 10` and set it to current `node`'s `next`, then advance current `node` to `next`.
- Advance both `p` and `q`.
- Check if `carry = 1`, if so append a new node with digit `1` to the returning list.
- Return dummy head's `next` `node`.

<b>Note</b> that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the head's value.

class Node {
  constructor(value, next = null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

function addTwoNumbers(l1, l2) {
  let List = new Node(0);
  let head = List;
  let sum = 0;
  let carry = 0;

  while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null || sum > 0) {
    if (l1 !== null) {
      sum += l1.value;
      l1 = l1.next;
    }
    if (l2 !== null) {
      sum += l2.value;
      l2 = l2.next;
    }
    if (sum >= 10) {
      carry = 1;
      sum -= 10;
    }

    head.next = new Node(sum);
    head = head.next;

    sum = carry;
    carry = 0;
  }
  return List.next;
}

l1 = new Node(2);
l1.next = new Node(4);
l1.next.next = new Node(3);
l2 = new Node(5);
l2.next = new Node(6);
l2.next.next = new Node(4);
addTwoNumbers(l1, l2); //[7,0,8], 342 + 465 = 807.

l1 = new Node(0);
l2 = new Node(0);
addTwoNumbers(l1, l2); //[0]

l1 = new Node(9);
l1.next = new Node(9);
l1.next.next = new Node(9);
l1.next.next.next = new Node(9);
l1.next.next.next.next = new Node(9);
l1.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(9);
l1.next.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(9);
l2 = new Node(9);
l2.next = new Node(9);
l2.next.next = new Node(9);
l2.next.next.next = new Node(9);
addTwoNumbers(l1, l2); //[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity is `O(max(m,n)`. Assume that `m` and `n` represents the length of `l1` and `l2` respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most `max(m, n)` times.
- Space complexity is `O(max(m,n)`. The length of the new list is at most `max(m,n)+1`.
