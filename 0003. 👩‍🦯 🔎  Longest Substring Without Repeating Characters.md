# 3. 👩‍🦯  🔎 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Given a string `s`, find the length of the <b>longest substring</b> without repeating characters.

 

## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```` 
## Example 3:
````
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
````
## Example 4:
````
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```` 

## Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution with Map Class
````
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  //sliding window with a hashmap
  let maxLength = 0
  let windowStart = 0
  let charIndexMap = new Map()
  
  for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length; windowEnd++) {
    //try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
    const endChar = s[windowEnd]
    
    //if the map alread contains the endChar,
    //shrink the window from the beggining
    //so that we only have one occurance of endChar
    if(charIndexMap.has(endChar)) {
      //this is tricky; in the current window,
      //we will not have any endChar after
      //it's previous index.  If windowStart
      //is already ahead of the last index
      //endChar, we will keep windowStart
      windowStart = Math.max(windowStart, charIndexMap.get(endChar)+1)
    }
    
    //insert endChar into the map
    charIndexMap.set(endChar, windowEnd)
    
    //remeber the maxLength so far
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1)
  }
  
  return maxLength   
};

lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb")//3,The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb")//1, The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew")//3,The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
lengthOfLongestSubstring("")//0

## Solution with Map Object
````
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  // sliding window with hashmap
  let windowStart = 0
  let maxLength = 0
  let charIndexMap = {}
  
  //try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
  for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length; windowEnd++) {
    const endChar = s[windowEnd]
    
    //if the map already contains the endChar, 
    //shrink the window from the beginning 
    //so that we only have on occurance of endChar
    if(endChar in charIndexMap) {
    
      //this is tricky; in the current window, 
      //we will not have any endChar after
      //it's previous index. and if windowStart
      //is already ahead of the last index of
      //endChar, we'll keep windowStart
      windowStart = Math.max(windowStart, charIndexMap[endChar] + 1)
    }
    
    //insert the endChar into the map
    charIndexMap[endChar] = windowEnd
    
    //remember the maximum length so far
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart+1)
  } 
  return maxLength
};

lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb")//3,The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb")//1, The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew")//3,The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
lengthOfLongestSubstring("")//0

## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm’s time complexity will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of characters in the input string.
- The algorithm’s space complexity is `O(N)` since, in the worst case, the whole pattern can have distinct characters that will go into the HashMap.  This also means `K<=N`, because in the worst case, the whole string might not have any repeating character, so the entire string will be added to the HashMap. Having said that, since we can expect a fixed set of characters in the input string (e.g., 26 for English letters), we can say that the algorithm runs in fixed space `O(1)`; in this case, we can use a fixed-size array instead of the HashMap.
