## 11. 🔎👩🏽‍🦯 Container With Most Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the `x-axis` form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the <i>maximum amount of water a container</i> can store.

<b>Notice</b> that you may not slant the container.
## Example 1:

````
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
````

## Constraints:

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution 
````js
function maxArea(height) {
  let maxArea = 0;
  let start = 0
  let end = height.length - 1

  
  while(start < end) {
    let wall = Math.min(height[start], height[end]);
    let area = wall * (end - start)
    
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
    
    if(height[start] < height[end]) {
      start++
    } else 
      {
        end--
      }
  }

  return maxArea;
}

maxArea([1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]); //49, The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
//In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

maxArea([1, 1]); //1
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity of `O(n)` in single pass.
- Space complexity of `O(1)`, Constant space is used.
