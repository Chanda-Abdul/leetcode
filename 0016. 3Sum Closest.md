# 16. 3Sum Closest
#TwoPointers #Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Example 1:

#### Input: `nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1`
#### Output: `2`
#### Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is `2`. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 

## Constraints:

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

## My Solution 
````
function threeSumClosest(nums, target) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    
    let smallestDifference = Infinity
    
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length-2; i++) {
        let start = i + 1
        let end = nums.length - 1
        
        while(start < end) {
            const targetDifference = target - nums[i] - nums[start] - nums[end]
            
            if(targetDifference === 0) {
                //we've found a triplet with an exact sum
                //so return the sum of all the numbers
                return target - targetDifference
            }
            
            if(Math.abs(targetDifference) < Math.abs(smallestDifference)){
               //save the closet difference
                smallestDifference = targetDifference
               }
            //the second part of the following 'if' is to handle the smallest sum
            //when we have more than one solution
            if(Math.abs(targetDifference) < Math.abs(smallestDifference) || (Math.abs(targetDifference) === Math.abs(smallestDifference) && targetDifference > smallestDifference)) {
                //save the closest and the biggest difference
                smallestDifference = targetDifference
            }
            if(targetDifference > 0){
                //we need a triplet with a bigger sum
                start++
            }
            else {
                //we need a triplet with a bigger sum
                end--
            }
        }
    }
    return target - smallestDifference  
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- Sorting the array will take `O(N* logN)`. Overall, the function will take `O(N * logN + N^2)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N^2)`
- The above algorithmâ€™s space complexity will be `O(N)`, which is required for sorting.
