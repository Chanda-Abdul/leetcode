# 19. üë©‚Äçü¶Ø Remove Nth Node From End of List
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n`th node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
````
 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`
 

## Follow up
- [x] Could you do this in one pass?

## Solution
````
class Node {
  constructor(value, next = null) {
    this.value = value
    this.next = next
  }
}


function removeNthFromEnd(head, n) {
  //edge cases
  //linkedList is the same length as n
  if(!head.next) return null
  
  // As we want the slow node before the one we are deleting,
  const newHead = new Node(null, head)
  
  let fast = head
  let slow = newHead
  
  // move fast ahead by n
	// we want fast to be ahead by an additional node
  while(fast) {
    fast = fast.next
    if(n > 0) {
      n--
    } else {
      slow = slow.next
    }
  }
  
  //remove slow.next
  slow.next = slow.next.next
 
  return newHead.next
};

head = new Node(1)
head.next = new Node(2)
head.next.next = new Node(3)
head.next.next.next = new Node(4)
head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5)
removeNthFromEnd(head, 2)

head = new Node(1)
removeNthFromEnd(head, 1)

head = new Node(1)
head.next = new Node(2)
removeNthFromEnd(head, 1)
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm‚Äôs time complexity will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of characters in the Linked List.
- The algorithm‚Äôs space complexity is `O(1)`
