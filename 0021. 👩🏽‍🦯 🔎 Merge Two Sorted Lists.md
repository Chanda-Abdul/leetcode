# 21. üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø üîé Merge Two Sorted Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)
````
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
````
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution 
````
class ListNode {
  constructor(val, next = null) {
    this.value = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

function mergeTwoLists(l1, l2) {
  // initialize a dummy head node
  const merged = new ListNode(-1);
  
  // initialize a current variable to keep track of the current node, starting with the dummy head node
  let current = merged;

  while (l1 && l2) {
    // if value of l1 node is less than value of l2 node
  
      if (l1.val > l2.val) {
        // set the current node's link to l2 node
        current.next = l2;
        // set the l2 node to l2's next node
        l2 = l2.next;
  
      } else {
        // set the l1 node to l1's next node
        current.next = l1;
        // set the l1 node to l1's next node
        l1 = l1.next;
      }
    
    // move on to the next node
    current = current.next;
    
    // if one of the lists no longer have any nodes to compare, point current's link to the remaining nodes in the other list
  }
 
  // if both lists are empty, point crt's link to null
  current.next = l1 || l2;

  return merged.next;
}

let l1 = new ListNode(1);
l1.next = new ListNode(2);
l1.next.next = new ListNode(4);
let l2 = new ListNode(1);
l2.next = new ListNode(3);
l2.next.next = new ListNode(4);
mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);

l1 = new ListNode(null);
l2 = new ListNode(null);
mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);

l1 = new ListNode(null);
l2 = new ListNode(0);
mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);

````

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time complexity : `O(n + m)`

Because exactly one of `l1` and `l2` is incremented on each loop iteration, the while loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the sum of the lengths of the two lists. All other work is constant, so the overall complexity is linear.

- Space complexity : `O(1)`

The iterative approach only allocates a few pointers, so it has a constant overall memory footprint.
