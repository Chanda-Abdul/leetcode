# 25. ðŸ˜• Reverse Nodes in k-Group
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list `k` at a time and return its modified list.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. ðŸ˜• <u><b>If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is(FIX THIS!)ðŸ˜•</u></b>.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex1.jpg)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
````
## Example 4:
````
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
````

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= sz`
 

## Follow-up: 
- [x] Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?

## Solution 
````
function reverseKGroup(head, k) {
    let val = head
    let prev = null
    
    while(true) {
        const lastNodeOfPreviousPart = prev
        
        //after reversing the LL val will 
        //be the last node of the sublist
        const lastNodeOfSubList = val
        
        //will be used to temporarily store the next node
        let next = null
        
        let i = 0
        
        //reverse k nodes
        while(val !== null && i < k) {
            next = val.next
            val.next = prev
            prev = val
            val = next
            i++
            
        }
        
        //connect with previous part
        if(lastNodeOfPreviousPart !== null) {
            lastNodeOfPreviousPart.next = prev
        } else {
            head = prev
        }
        
        //connect with the next part
        lastNodeOfSubList.next = val
        
        if(val === null) {
            break
        }
        prev = lastNodeOfSubList
    }
    
    return head
};

## Time And Space Complexity 
- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.
