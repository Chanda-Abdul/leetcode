# 26. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates <b>in-place</b> such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

### Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by <b>reference</b>, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

````
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
 ````

## Example 1:

Given `nums = [1,1,2]`,

Your function should return `length = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `1` and `2` respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

## Example 2:

Given `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`,

Your function should return `length = 5`, with the first five elements of nums being modified to `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.


## My Solution

````
function removeDuplicates (nums) {
    //two pointers
    //one to iterate
    let i = 1
    //one to update
    let nextNonDupe = 1
    
    
    while(i < nums.length) {
        if(nums[nextNonDupe] !== nums[i]){
            nums[nextNonDupe] = nums[i]
            nextNonDupe++
            i++
           }
        i++
    }
    
    return nextNonDupe
};

removeDuplicates([1, 1, 2])//2
removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4])//5
````

- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, where `‚ÄòN‚Äô` is the total number of elements in the given array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
