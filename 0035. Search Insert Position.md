# 35. Search Insert Position
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the `target` is found. If not, return the `index` where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
````
## Example 4:
````
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
````
## Example 5:
````
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: 0
````

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- `-104 <= target <= 10^4`
## Solution
````
function searchInsert (nums, target) {
    let low = 0
    let high = nums.length -1
    
    while(low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low+high)/2)
        
        if(nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid
        }
        if(nums[mid] > target){
            high = mid -1
        }
        if(nums[mid] < target){
            low = mid+1
        }
    }
    
    return low
    
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(log n)` because we are dividing the array in half on each iteration.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
