## 🔎 👩‍🦯 48. Rotate Image
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

You are given an `n x n 2D` matrix representing an image, rotate the image by <b>90</b> degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. <b>DO NOT</b> allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat1.jpg)
````
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat2.jpg)
````
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
````

## Constraints:

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`

## Solution ➡️ Approach 2: Reverse on Diagonal and then Reverse Left to Right
### Intuition

The most elegant solution for rotating the matrix is to firstly reverse the matrix around the main diagonal, and then reverse it from left to right. These operations are called transpose and reflect in linear algebra.

Even though this approach does twice as many reads and writes as approach 1, most people would consider it a better approach because the code is simpler, and it is built with standard matrix operations that can be found in any matrix library.
````
function rotate(matrix) {
  //transpose the matrix
  for (let x = 0; x < matrix.length; x++) {
    for (let y = x; y < matrix[0].length; y++) {
      [matrix[x][y], matrix[y][x]] = [matrix[y][x], matrix[x][y]];
    }
  }

  //reverse each row
  for (let x = 0; x < matrix.length; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < matrix[0].length / 2; y++) {
      [matrix[x][y], matrix[x][matrix[0].length - y - 1]] = [
        matrix[x][matrix[0].length - y - 1],
        matrix[x][y],
      ];
    }
  }

  console.log(matrix);
}

rotate([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
]); //[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]])
rotate([
  [5, 1, 9, 11],
  [2, 4, 8, 10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15, 14, 12, 16],
]); //[[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]])

## Time & Space Complexity
Let `M` be the number of cells in the grid.

- Time complexity is `O(M)`. We perform two steps; transposing the matrix, and then reversing each row. Transposing the matrix has a cost of `O(M)` because we're moving the value of each cell once. Reversing each row also has a cost of `O(M)`, because again we're moving the value of each cell once.
- Space complexity `O(1)` because we do not use any other additional data structures.
