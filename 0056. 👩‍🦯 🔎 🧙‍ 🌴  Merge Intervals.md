# 56. 👩‍🦯 🔎 🧙‍♀️ 🌴 Merge Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

## Example 1:
````
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
````
## Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start[i] <= end[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution 
````js
function merge(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length - 1; i++) {
    if (intervals[i][1] >= intervals[i + 1][0]) {
      intervals[i] = [
        intervals[i][0],
        Math.max(intervals[i + 1][1], intervals[i][1]),
      ];
      intervals.splice(i + 1, 1);
      i--;
    }
  }

  return intervals;
}

merge([[1, 3], [2, 6], [15, 18], [8, 10]]); 
//[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]], Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
merge([[1, 4],[4, 5]]); 
//[[1,5]], Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

## Solution with Interval class
````js
class Interval {
  constructor(start, end) {
    this.start = start;
    this.end = end;
  }

  get_interval() {
    return "[" + this.start + ", " + this.end + "]";
  }
}

function merge (intervals) {
  if(intervals.length < 2) {
    return intervals
  }
  
  //sort the intervals on the start time
  intervals.sort((a,b) => a.start - b.start
                )
  const mergedIntervals = []
  
  let start = intervals[0].start
  let end = intervals[0].end
  
  for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const interval = intervals[i]
    if(interval.start <= end) {
      //overlapping intervals, adjust the end
      end = Math.max(interval.end, end)    
    } else {
      //non-overlapping intercal, add the precious interval and reset
      mergedIntervals.push(new Interval(start, end))
      start = interval.start
      end = interval.end
    }
  }
  //add the last interval
  mergedIntervals.push(new Interval(start, end))
  return mergedIntervals;
};

merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(1, 4), new Interval(2, 5), new Interval(7, 9)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
//Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into one [1,5].


merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(6, 7), new Interval(2, 4), new Interval(5, 9)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
//Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].


merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(1, 4), new Interval(2, 6), new Interval(3, 5)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[1,6]]
//Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.

## Time  & Complexity
- The splice function can become a little expensive as `i` approaches `0` and the array has to be <i>spliced</i> (worst case scenario `O(n * (n - i)`) when `i` is relatively small, i.e. when the splice fires a number of times around the beginning of an intervals array which is large). This kind of method works better with a Linked List since the removal of an explicitly known node is `O(1)`

<b>OR </b>

- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N * logN)`, where `N` is the total number of intervals. We are iterating the intervals only once which will take `O(N)`, in the beginning though, since we need to sort the intervals, our algorithm will take `O(N * logN)`.
- The <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals. We will also need `O(N)` space for sorting
