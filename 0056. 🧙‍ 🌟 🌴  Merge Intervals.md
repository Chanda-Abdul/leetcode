# 56. 🧙‍♀️ 🌟 🌴 Merge Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

## Example 1:

### Input: 
`intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
### Output: 
`[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
### Explanation: 
`Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].`

## Example 2:

### Input: 
`intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
### Output: 
`[[1,5]]`
### Explanation: 
`Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.` 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`

## My Solution 
````
const merge = function(intervals) {
  if(intervals.length < 2) return intervals
  //sort
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])
  for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    let current = intervals[i]
    let previous = intervals[i-1]
    if(current[0] <= previous[1]) {
      intervals[i] =[previous[0], Math.max(previous[1], current[1])]
      intervals.splice(i-1, 1)
      i--
    }
  }
  
  
  return intervals
    
};

merge([[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]])
merge([[1,4],[4,5]])
merge([[1,4]])

## Solution with Interval class
````
class Interval {
  constructor(start, end) {
    this.start = start;
    this.end = end;
  }

  get_interval() {
    return "[" + this.start + ", " + this.end + "]";
  }
}

function merge (intervals) {
  if(intervals.length < 2) {
    return intervals
  }
  
  //sort the intervals on the start time
  intervals.sort((a,b) => a.start - b.start
                )
  const mergedIntervals = []
  
  let start = intervals[0].start
  let end = intervals[0].end
  
  for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const interval = intervals[i]
    if(interval.start <= end) {
      //overlapping intervals, adjust the end
      end = Math.max(interval.end, end)    
    } else {
      //non-overlapping intercal, add the precious interval and reset
      mergedIntervals.push(new Interval(start, end))
      start = interval.start
      end = interval.end
    }
  }
  //add the last interval
  mergedIntervals.push(new Interval(start, end))
  return mergedIntervals;
};

merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(1, 4), new Interval(2, 5), new Interval(7, 9)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
//Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into one [1,5].


merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(6, 7), new Interval(2, 4), new Interval(5, 9)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
//Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].


merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(1, 4), new Interval(2, 6), new Interval(3, 5)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[1,6]]
//Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.

## Time  & Complexity
- The splice function can become a little expensive as `i` approaches 0 and the array has to be spliced (worst case scenario `O(n * (n - i)`) when i is relatively small, i.e. when the splice fires a number of times around the beginning of an intervals array which is large). This kind of method works better with a Linked List since the removal of an explicitly known node is `O(1)`

<b>OR </b>

- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N * logN)`, where `N` is the total number of intervals. We are iterating the intervals only once which will take `O(N)`, in the beginning though, since we need to sort the intervals, our algorithm will take `O(N * logN)`.
- The <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals. We will also need `O(N)` space for sorting
