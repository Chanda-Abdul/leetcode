# 57. ðŸ”Ž Insert Interval
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/

You are given an array of non-overlapping `intervals` intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and intervals still does not have any overlapping `intervals` (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

### Example 1:
````
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
````
### Example 2:
````
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
````
### Example 3:
````
Input: intervals = [], newInterval = [5,7]
Output: [[5,7]]
````
### Example 4:
````
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,3]
Output: [[1,5]]
````
### Example 5:
````
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,7]
Output: [[1,7]]
````
## Constraints:

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1] <= 105`
- `intervals` is sorted by `intervals[i][0]` in ascending order.
- `newInterval.length == 2`
- `0 <= newInterval[0] <= newInterval[1] <= 105`

## Solution
````
function insert(intervals, newInterval) {
  if(intervals.length === 0) return [newInterval]
  
  let merged = []
  let i = 0
  //1. skip and add all intervals that come before newIntervals
  while(i < intervals.length && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
    merged.push(intervals[i])
    i++
  }

  //2. merge all intervals that overlap with newInterval
  while(i < intervals.length && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
    newInterval[0] = Math.min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0])
    newInterval[1] = Math.max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1])
    i++
  }
  
  //3. insert the newInterval
  merged.push(newInterval)

  //4. add remaining intervals to the input
  while(i < intervals.length) {
    merged.push(intervals[i])
    i++
  }
  
  return merged;
}

insert([[1, 5]], [6, 8]);
insert([[1, 5]], [2, 7]);//[1,7]
insert([], [2, 5]);
insert([[1,3],[6,9]], [2,5])//[[1,5],[6,9]]
insert([[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], [4,8])//[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]], Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

## Time & Space Complexity

- As we are iterating through all the intervals only once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of intervals.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals.
