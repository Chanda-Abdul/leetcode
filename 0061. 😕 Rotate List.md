# 61. ðŸ˜• Rotate List
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
````
##  Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)
````

Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```` 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 109`

## Solution 
````
function rotateRight(head, k) {
    
    let myList = new ListNode()
    myList = head
    
    if(head === null || head.next === null || k <= 0) return head
    
    //find the length of the last node of the list
    // let lastNode = head
    console.log(head.next.val)
    let listLength = 1
    
    while(head.val !== null) {
        head.val = head.next.val
        listLength++
    }
    
    //connect the last node with the head to make it a circular list
    head.next.val = head
    
    //no need to do rotations more than the length of the list
    k %= listLength
    let skipLength = listLength - k
    let lastNodeofRotatedList = head
    
    for(let i = 0; i < skipLength - 1; i++) {
        lastNodeofRotatedList = lastNodeofRotatedList.next
    }
    
    //lastNodeofRotatedList.next is pointing to the sub-list of k ending nodes
    head = lastNodeofRotatedList.next
    lastNodeofRotatedList.next = null
    
    return head
    
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `â€˜Nâ€™` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.
