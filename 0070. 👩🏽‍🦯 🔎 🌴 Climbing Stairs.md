# 70. 👩🏽‍🦯 🔎 🌴 Climbing Stairs
https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


## Example 1:
````js
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
````

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 45`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Bottom-up Dynamic Programming Solution
````js
function climbStairs(n) {
  let dp = [0, 1, 2];

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }

  return dp[n];
}

climbStairs(n = 2);
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
// 1. 1 step + 1 step
// 2. 2 steps

climbStairs(n = 3);
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
// 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
// 2. 1 step + 2 steps
// 3. 2 steps + 1 step
````


## Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time complexity</b>: `O(n)`. Single loop up to `n`.
- <b>Space complexity</b>: `O(n)`. `dp[]` of size `n` is used.
