# 75. Sort Colors
#TwoPointers #Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/

Given an array `nums` with `n `objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

 

## Example 1:

#### Input: `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`
#### Output: `[0,0,1,1,2,2]`
## Example 2:

#### Input: `nums = [2,0,1]`
#### Output: `[0,1,2]`
## Example 3:

#### Input: `nums = [0]`
#### Output: `[0]`
## Example 4:

#### Input: `nums = [1]`
#### Output: `[1]`
 

## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.
 

## Follow up:

- [x] Could you solve this problem without using the library's sort function?
- [x] Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only `O(1)` constant space?

## My Solution 
````
function sortColors(nums) {
    //all elements < low are 0, and all elements > high are 2
    //all elements >= low < i are 1
    let low = 0
    let high = nums.length -1
    let i = 0
    
    while(i <= high) {
        if(nums[i] === 0) {
            //swap
            //[arr[i], arr[low]] = [arr[low], arr[i]]
            let temp = nums[i]
            nums[i] = nums[low]
            nums[low] = temp
            //increment i and low
            i++
            low++
        }
        else if(nums[i] === 1) {
            //the case for arr[i] === 2
            //swap
            i++
        } else {
            //the case for arr[i] === 2
            //swap
            // [arr[i], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i]]
            let temp = nums[i]
            nums[i] = nums[high]
            nums[high] = temp
            high--
        }
    }    
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we are iterating the input array only once.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
