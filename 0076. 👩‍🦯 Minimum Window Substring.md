# 76. üë©‚Äçü¶Ø Minimum Window Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
## Example 1:
#### Input: `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`
#### Output: `"BANC"`
#### Explanation: 
````
The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
````
## Example 2:
#### Input: `s = "a", t = "a"`
#### Output: `"a"`
#### Explanation: `The entire string s is the minimum window.`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `s = "a", t = "aa"`
#### Output: `""`
#### Explanation: 
````
Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
````
 

## Constraints:
- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
## Follow up
- [x] Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
## Solution 
````
function minWindow(str, pattern) {
    let windowStart = 0
    let matched = 0
    let substrStart = 0
    let minLength = str.length + 1
    let charFreq = {}
    
    for(let i = 0; i < pattern.length; i++) {
        const char = pattern[i]
        if(!(char in charFreq)) {
          charFreq[char] = 0
        }
        charFreq[char]++
      }
    
    //try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
    for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < str.length; windowEnd++) {
        const endChar = str[windowEnd]
        if(endChar in charFreq) {
            charFreq[endChar]--
            if(charFreq[endChar] >= 0) {
                //count every matching of a character
                matched++
            }
        }
        //Shrink the window if we can, finish as soon as we remove a 
        //matched character
        while(matched === pattern.length) {
            if(minLength > windowEnd - windowStart + 1) {
                minLength = windowEnd - windowStart + 1
                substrStart = windowStart
            }
            
            const startChar = str[windowStart]
            windowStart++
            
            if(startChar in charFreq) {
                if(charFreq[startChar] === 0) {
                    matched--
                }
                charFreq[startChar]++
        
            }
      }
    } 
    
    if(minLength > str.length) {
        return ''
    }
 
    return str.substring(substrStart, substrStart + minLength)  
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N + M)` where `‚ÄòN‚Äô` and `‚ÄòM‚Äô` are the number of characters in the input string and the pattern respectively.
- The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(M`) since in the worst case, the whole pattern can have distinct characters which will go into the `HashMap`. In the worst case, we also need `O(N)` space for the resulting substring, which will happen when the input string is a permutation of the pattern.
