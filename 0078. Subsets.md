# 78. Subsets
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`
#### Output: `[[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `nums = [0]`
#### Output: `[[],[0]]`
 
## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the numbers of `nums` are <b>unique</b>.

## Solution 
````
function subsets (nums) {
    //start by declaring output array and adding the empty subset
    let subsets = [[]]
  
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        //we will take all existing subsets and insert the current number in them to create new subsets
        let n = subsets.length
        for(let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            //create a new subset from the existing subset and insert the current element to it?
            //clone the permutation?
            subsets.push([...subsets[j], nums[i]])
        }
    }
    
    return subsets
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of `O(2ᴺ)` subsets, where `‘N’` is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N*2ᴺ)`.
- All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have a total of `O(2ᴺ)` subsets, and each subset can take up to `O(N)` space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N*2ᴺ)`.
