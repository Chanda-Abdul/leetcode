# 90. Subsets II
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
## Example 1:
#### Input: `nums = [1,2,2]`
#### Output: `[[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `nums = [0]`
#### Output: `[[],[0]]`
 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

## Solution 
````
function subsetsWithDup (nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a-b)
    
    let subsets = [[]]
    
    let current = 0
    
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        //if the current and previous elements are the same,
        //create new subsets only from the subsets added in the previous step
        let next = subsets.length
        
        for(let j = current; j < next; j++) {
            //create a new subset from the existing subset and add the current element to it
            subsets.push([...subsets[j], nums[i]])
            
            if(nums[i+1] === nums[i]) {
              current = next
            } else {
              current = 0
            }   
        }
    }
    
    return subsets   
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles (if not duplicate) as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of `O(2ᴺ)` subsets, where `‘N’` is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N*2ᴺ)`.
- All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since, at most, we will have a total of `O(2ᴺ)` subsets, and each subset can take up to `O(N)` space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N*2ᴺ)`.
