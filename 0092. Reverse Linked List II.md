# 92. Reverse Linked List II
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg)
#### Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4`
#### Output: `[1,4,3,2,5]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `head = [5], left = 1, right = 1`
#### Output: `[5]`
 
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`
 
## My Solution
````
function reverseBetween (head, left, right) {
    //edge case
    if(left === right) return head
    
    //after skipping left-1 nodes
    //current will point to the [left] node
    let current = head
    let previous = null
    
    let i = 0
    
    while(current !== null & i < left - 1) {
        previous = current
        current = current.next
        i++
    }
    
    //we are interested in three parts of the LL
    //1. the part before index left
    //2. the part between left and right
    //3. and the part after index right
    
    const lastNodeOfFirstPart = previous
    
    //after reversing the LL current will
    //become the last node of the subList
    const lastNodeOfSubList = current
    
    //will be used to temporarily store the next node
    let next = null
    
    i = 0
    
    //reverse nodes between left and right
    while(current !== null && i < right - left + 1) {
        next = current.next
        current.next = previous
        previous = current
        current = next
        i++
    }
    
    //connect with the first part
    if(lastNodeOfFirstPart !== null) {
        //previous is now the first node of the sub list
        lastNodeOfFirstPart.next = previous
        
        //this means left === 1 
        //i.e., we are changing the first node(head) of the LL   
    } else {
        head = previous
    }
    
    //connect with the last part
    lastNodeOfSubList.next = current
    return head
    
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.
