# 98. 👩🏽‍🦯 🌴 Validate Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, <i>determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)</i>.

A <b>valid BST</b> is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys <b>less than</b> the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys <b>greater than</b> the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


## Example 1:

````
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)
````
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
````

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31-1`

## Approach 1: Recursive Traversal with Valid Range 

### Intuition
On the first sight, the problem is trivial. Let's traverse the tree and check at each step if `node.right.val > node.val` and `node.left.val < node.val`. This approach would even work for some trees compute
![](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/Figures/98/98_not_bst.png)
The problem is this approach will not work for all cases. Not only the right child should be larger than the node but all the elements in the right subtree. Here is an example :
![](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/Figures/98/98_not_bst_3.png)

That means one should keep both upper and lower limits for each node while traversing the tree, and compare the node value not with children values but with these limits.

### Algorithm 

The idea above could be implemented as a <i>recursion</i>. One compares the node value with its upper and lower limits if they are available. Then one repeats the same step recursively for left and right subtrees.

````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value, left = null, right = null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function isValidBST(root, min = -Infinity, max = Infinity) {
  if (root === null) return true;

  if (min >= root.value || max <= root.value) return false;

  return isValidBST(root.left, min, root.value) && isValidBST(root.right, root.value, max)
}

let root = new TreeNode(2);
root.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);

isValidBST(root);
//true

root = new TreeNode(5);
root.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(4);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(3);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(6);

isValidBST(root);
//false, The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
````

## Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)` because we will vist each exactly once.
- The space complexity is `O(N)` since we keep up to the entire tree.
