https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/


Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)
### Input: 
`root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
### Output: 
`[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]`
### Explanation: 

## Example 2:

### Input: 
`root = [1]`
### Output: 
`[[1]]`
### Explanation: 

## Example 3:

### Input: 
`root = []`
### Output: 
`[]`
### Explanation: 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## My Solution 
````
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
  this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
  this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
  this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 }
 
var levelOrder = function(root) {
  //edge case => if root is null return an empty array
  if(!root) return []
 
  
   //initialize the queue with root
  const queue = [root] 
  
   //declare output array
  const levels = [] 
  
  while(queue.length > 0) {
      //get the length prior to deque
      const queueLength = queue.length
      
      //declare this level
      const currLevel = []
      
      //loop through to exahuast all options and only to include nodes at currLevel
      for(let i = 0; i < queueLength; i++) {
          
          //get next node
          const currentNode = queue.shift()
          
          if(currentNode.left) {
              queue.push(currentNode.left)
          }
          if(currentNode.right) {
              queue.push(currentNode.right)
          }
          
          //after we add left and right for currentNode, we add to currLevel
          currLevel.push(currentNode.val)
      }
      
      //Level has been finished. Push into output array
      levels.push(currLevel) 
  }
    
    return levels
};

levelOrder([3,9,20,null,null,15,7])//[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
levelOrder([1])//[[1]]
levelOrder([])//[]
````

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.
