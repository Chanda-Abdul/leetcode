# 102. 👩🏽‍🦯 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/


> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from `left` to `right`, level by level).
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)
```js
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```
## Example 2:
```js
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
## Example 3:
```js
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution 
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}
function levelOrder(root) {
  //edge case => if root is null return an empty array
  if (!root) return [];

  //initialize the queue with root
  const queue = [root];

  //declare output array
  const levels = [];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    //get the length prior to deque
    const queueLength = queue.length;

    //declare this level
    const currLevel = [];

    //loop through to exahuast all options and only to include nodes at currLevel
    for (let i = 0; i < queueLength; i++) {
      //get next node
      const currNode = queue.shift();

      if (currNode.left) {
        queue.push(currNode.left);
      }

      if (currNode.right) {
        queue.push(currNode.right);
      }

      //after we add left and right for currNode,
      //we add to currLevel
      currLevel.push(currNode.val);
    }

    //Level has been finished. Push into output array
    levels.push(currLevel);
  }
  return levels;
}

let root = new TreeNode(3)
root.left = new TreeNode(9)
root.right = new TreeNode(20)
root.right.left = new TreeNode(15)
root.right.right = new TreeNode(7)
levelOrder(root); 
//[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

root = new TreeNode(1)
levelOrder(root); 
//[[1]]

root = new TreeNode(null)
levelOrder(root); 
//[]

## Complexity Analysis
- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the <b>queue</b>. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the <b>queue</b>.
