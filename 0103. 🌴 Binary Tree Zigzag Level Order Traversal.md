# 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal ðŸŒ´
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)
### Input: 
`root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
### Output: 
`[[3],[20,9],[15,7]]`
### Explanation: 

## Example 2:

### Input: 
`root = [1]`
### Output: 
`[[1]]`
### Explanation: 

## Example 3:

### Input: 
`root = []`
### Output: 
`[]`
### Explanation: 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## My Solution 
````
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
  this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
  this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
  this.right = (right === undefined ? nill : right)
}

function zigzagLevelOrder(root) {
  //if root is null return an empty array
  if(!root) return []
  
  //initialize the queue with root
  const queue = [root]
  //declare the output array
  const levels = []
  let leftToRight = true
  
  while(queue.length !== 0) {
    //get the length prior to deque?
    const queueLength = queue.length
    //declare the current level
    const currentLevel = []
    
    //loop through to exhaust all aoption and only to include nodes at current Level
    for (let i = 0; i < queueLength; i++) {
      //get the next node
      const currentNode = queue.shift()
      
      //add the node to the current level based on the traverse direction
      if(leftToRight) {
        currentLevel.push(currentNode.val)
      } else {
        currentLevel.unshift(currentNode.val)
      }
      
      //insert the children of current node in the queue
      if(currentNode.left !== null) {
        queue.push(currentNode.left) 
      }
      if(currentNode.right !== null) {
        queue.push(currentNode.right)
      }
    }
    //Level has been finished. push to the out put arra
    levels.push(currentLevel)
    
    //resverse the traversal direction 
    leftToRight = !leftToRight
  }
  return levels
}

zigzagLevelOrder([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
zigzagLevelOrder([3,9,20,null,null,15,7])
zigzagLevelOrder([1])
zigzagLevelOrder([])
````

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.
