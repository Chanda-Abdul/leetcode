# 104. 👩🏽‍🦯 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's <b>maximum depth</b> is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)
```js
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
## Example 2:
```js
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```
## Example 3:
```js
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```
## Example 4:
```js
Input: root = [0]
Output: 1
```
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
## Approach 1: Recursion
```js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function maxDepth(root) {
  function maxDepthRecursiveDFS(root) {
    //base case
    if (!root) return 0;

    let leftMax = maxDepthRecursiveDFS(root.left);
    let rightMax = maxDepthRecursiveDFS(root.right);
    return Math.max(leftMax, rightMax) + 1;
  }

  return maxDepthRecursiveDFS(root);
}

let root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(9);
root.right = new TreeNode(20);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(15);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(7);
maxDepth(root);
//3

root = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(2);
maxDepth(root);
//2

root = null;
maxDepth(root);
//0

root = new TreeNode([0]);
maxDepth(root);
//1
```
### Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time complexity</b> : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- <b>Space complexity</b> : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur `N` times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be `O(N)`. But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be `log(N)`. Therefore, the <b>space complexity</b> in this case would be `O(log(N)`.

## Approach 2: Iteration
We could also convert the above recursion into iteration, with the help of the stack data structure. Similar with the behaviors of the function call stack, the stack data structure follows the pattern of FILO (First-In-Last-Out), i.e. the last element that is added to a stack would come out first.

With the help of the stack data structure, one could mimic the behaviors of function call stack that is involved in the recursion, to convert a recursive function to a function with iteration.

````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function maxDepth(root) {
  //edge case => no root
  if (!root) return 0;
  

  let queue = [root];

  let maximumTreeDepth = 0;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    maximumTreeDepth++;
    const levelSize = queue.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      let currentNode = queue.shift();

      //insert the children of the currentNode in the queue
      if (currentNode.left !== null) {
        queue.push(currentNode.left);
      }
      if (currentNode.right !== null) {
        queue.push(currentNode.right);
      }
    }
  }
  return maximumTreeDepth;
}

let root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(9);
root.right = new TreeNode(20);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(15);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(7);
maxDepth(root);
//3

root = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(2);
maxDepth(root);
//2

root = null;
maxDepth(root);
//0

root = new TreeNode([0]);
maxDepth(root);
//1

### Complexity Analysis
- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for the `queue`. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the `queue`.
