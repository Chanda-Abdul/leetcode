> Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where `preorder` is the <b>preorder traversal</b> of a <b>binary tree</b> and `inorder` is the <b>inorder traversal</b> of the same tree, construct and return the <b>binary tree</b>.



## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree.jpg)
````
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= preorder.length <= 3000`
- `inorder.length == preorder.length`
- `-3000 <= preorder[i]`, `inorder[i] <= 3000`
- `preorder` and `inorder` consist of <b>unique</b> values.
- Each value of `inorder` also appears in `preorder`.
- `preorder` is GUARANTEED to be the <b>preorder traversal</b> of the tree.
- `inorder` is GUARANTEED to be the <b>inorder traversal</b> of the tree.

## Approach 1: Recursion
### Intuition

The two key observations are:

- <b>Preorder traversal</b> follows `Root -> Left -> Right`, therefore, given the `preorder` array `preorder`, we have easy access to the `root` which is `preorder[0]`.
- <b>Inorder traversal</b> follows `Left -> Root -> Right`, therefore if we know the position of `Root`, we can <b>recursively</b> split the entire array into two <i>subtrees</i>.

Now the idea should be clear enough. We will design a <i>recursion function</i>: it will set the first element of `preorder` as the `root`, and then construct the entire tree. To find the `left` and `right` <i>subtrees</i>, it will look for the `root` in `inorder`, so that everything on the `left` should be the `left` <i>subtree</i>, and everything on the `right` should be the `right` <i>subtree</i>. Both <i>subtrees</i> can be constructed by making another <i>recursion call</i>.

It is worth noting that, while we <i>recursively</i> construct the <i>subtrees</i>, we should choose the next element in `preorder` to initialize as the new `roots`. This is because the current one has already been initialized to a <i>parent node</i> for the <i>subtrees</i>.

### Algorithm

- Build a <s>hashmap</s> to record the relation of `value -> index` for `inorder`, so that we can find the position of `root` in constant time.
- Initialize an integer variable `index` to keep track of the element that will be used to construct the `root`.
- Implement the <i>recursion function</i>  which takes a range of `inorder` and returns the constructed <i>binary tree</i>:
  - if the range is empty, return `null`;
  - initialize the `root` with `preorder[index]` and then increment `index`;
  - <i>recursively</i> use the `left` and `right` portions of `inorder` to construct the `left` and `right` <i>subtrees</i>.
- Simply call the <i>recursion function</i> with the entire range of `inorder`.

````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function buildTree(preorder, inorder) {
  //recursive base case
  if (inorder.length < 1) return null;

  //A preorder traversal is [node, left, right]
  //so we can use preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], to find the root = preorder[0] == 3
  const root = new TreeNode(preorder.shift());

  //an inorder traversal is [left, node, right].
  //then we can use inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], to build left and right subtrees
  //everything before [3] is in the left subtree, so [9]
  //everything after [3] is in the right subtree, so [15,20,7]

  //find index of root in inorder
  let index = inorder.indexOf(root.val);

  //anything left of root in inorder
  let leftTree = inorder.slice(0, index);

  //anything right of root in inorder
  let rightTree = inorder.slice(index + 1);

  root.left = buildTree(preorder, leftTree);
  root.right = buildTree(preorder, rightTree);

  return root;
}

buildTree(preorder = [3, 9, 20, 15, 7], inorder = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7]);
//Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

buildTree(preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]);
//Output: [-1]

## Complexity Analysis
Let `N` be the length of the input arrays.

- <b>Time complexity</b> : `O(N)`.
  - Building the <s>hashmap</s> takes `O(N)` time, as there are `N` nodes to add, and adding items to a <s>hashmap</s> has a cost of `O(1)`, so we get `N⋅O(1)=O(N)`.
  - Building the <i>tree</i> also takes `O(N)` time. The <i>recursive helper</i> method has a cost of `O(1)` for each call (it has no loops), and it is called once for each of the NN nodes, giving a total of `O(N)`.
  - Taking both into consideration, the <b>time complexity</b> is `O(N)`.

- <b>Space complexity</b> : `O(N)`.
  - Building the <s>hashmap</s> and storing the entire <i>tree</i> each requires `O(N)` memory. The size of the implicit system stack used by <i>recursion calls</i> depends on the height of the <i>tree</i>, which is `O(N)` in the worst case and `O(logN)` on average. Taking both into consideration, the <b>space complexity</b> is `O(N)`.
