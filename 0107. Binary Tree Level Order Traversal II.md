# 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
## Example 1:

### Input: 
`root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
### Output: 
`[[15,7],[9,20],[3]]`
### Explanation: 

## Example 2:

### Input: 
`root = [1]`
### Output: 
`[[1]]`
### Explanation: 

## Example 3:

### Input: 
`root = []`
### Output: 
`[]`
### Explanation: 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution 
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value, left = null, right = null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function reverseLevelOrder(root) {
  //If root is null return an empty array
  if (!root) return [];

  //initialize the queue with root
  const queue = [root];

  //declare output array
  const levels = [];

  while (queue.length !== 0) {
    //get the length prior to deque
    const queueLength = queue.length;

    //declare this level
    const currLevel = [];

    //loop through to exahuast all options and only to include nodes at currLevel
    for (let i = 0; i < queueLength; i++) {
      //get next node
      const currNode = queue.shift();

      if (currNode.left) {
        queue.push(currNode.left);
      }
      if (currNode.right) {
        queue.push(currNode.right);
      }
      //after we add left and right for current, we add to currLevel
      currLevel.push(currNode.value);
    }
    //Level has been finished. Push into output array in reverse order
    levels.unshift(currLevel);
  }

  return levels;
}

let root = new TreeNode(12);
root.left = new TreeNode(7);
root.right = new TreeNode(1);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(9);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(10);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(5);
reverseLevelOrder(root);
// [[9, 10, 5], [7, 1], [12]];

## Time Complexity
 - The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.
