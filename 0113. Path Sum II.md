# 113. Path Sum II
https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals `targetSum`.

A leaf is a node with no children.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsumii1.jpg)

### Input
`root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22`,
### Output
`[[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]`

## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg)
### Input
`root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5`
### Output
`[]`

## Example 3:
 
### Input
`root = [1,2], targetSum = 0`
### Output
`[]`


## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

## My Solution
````
 function pathSum(root, targetSum) {
  if(!root) return []
  const result = []
  const visited = []
    function traverse(node) {
      visited.push(node.val)
      
      if(!node.left && !node.right) {
          const leafSum = [...visited].reduce((a,b) => a+b)
          if(leafSum === targetSum) {
              result.push([...visited])
        } 
      }
             if(node.left) {
          traverse(node.left)
        } 
             if(node.right) {
          traverse(node.right)
        }
        visited.pop()
      }
    
  traverse(root)
  return result
};

var root = new TreeNode(12)
root.left = new TreeNode(7)
root.right = new TreeNode(1)
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = new TreeNode(10)
root.right.right = new TreeNode(5)
let sum = 23,
result = pathSum(root, sum);

process.stdout.write(`Tree paths with sum ${sum}: `);
for (i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
  process.stdout.write(`[${result[i]}] `);
}

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N^2)`, where `‘N’` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take `O(N)`), and for every leaf node, we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take `O(N)`.
  - We can calculate a tighter time complexity of `O(NlogN)` from the space complexity discussion below.
- If we ignore the space required for the `allPaths` list, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst-case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
