# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Say you have an array for which the `ith` element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

## Example 1:
````
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
````

## Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution 

````
function maxProfit(prices) {
    //we will greedily update minPrice and maxProfit, so we
    //initialize them to the first price and the first possible profit
    let maxProfit = 0 
    let minPrice = prices[0]
    
    // Start at the second (index 1) time
    // We can't sell at the first time, since we must buy first,
    // and we can't buy and sell at the same time!
    // If we started at index 0, we'd try to buy *and* sell at time 0.
    // this would give a profit of 0, which is a problem if our
    // maxProfit is supposed to be *negative*--we'd return 0.
    for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        let currentPrice = prices[i]
        
        //see what our profit would be if we bought at the
        //min price and sold at the current price
        let potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice
        
        //update maxProfit if we can do better
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit)
        
        //update minPrice so it's always
        //the lowest price we've seen so far
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, currentPrice)   
        
    }
    return maxProfit
}

maxProfit([1,2])
maxProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])//5,Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
maxProfit([7,6,4,3,1])//0, In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
````
## Time Complexity

`O(n)` time and `O(1)` space. We only loop through the array once.
