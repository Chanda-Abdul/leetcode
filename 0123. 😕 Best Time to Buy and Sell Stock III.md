# 123.:confused: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/
You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

##  Example 1:
````
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
````
## Example 4:
````
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
 ````
## Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`
## Solution 
````
function maxProfit (prices) {
  if(prices.length <= 1) return 0
  let buyCurrent = 0
  let sellCurrent = 1
  let currentMax = 0
  let maxProfit = 0
  let buy = 0
  
  while(buy <= prices.length - 1) {
    while(buyCurrent <= prices.length - 1) {
      
      for(let i = buyCurrent+1; i < prices.length; i++){
        currentMax = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i]-prices[buyCurrent])
        if(prices[i]-prices[buyCurrent] > currentMax) {
          sellCurrent = i
          buy = buyCurrent
        }
      }
    }
    
    
    buy++
    
  }
  
  return maxProfit  
};

maxProfit ([3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4])//6, Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

maxProfit ([1,2,3,4,5])//4, Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

maxProfit ([7,6,4,3,1])//0, In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
maxProfit ([1])//0
