# 124. 👩‍🦯  Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

A <b>path</b> in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence <b>at most once</b>. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The <b>path sum</b> of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum <b>path sum</b> of any path.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)
````
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)
````
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution 
````
function maxPathSum (root) {
    let maxSum = -Infinity
  
  function findAPath(currentNode) {
    if(!currentNode) {
      return 0
    }

    let leftSum = Math.max(0, findAPath(currentNode.left))
    
    let rightSum =  Math.max(0, findAPath(currentNode.right))
    let currentSum = currentNode.val + leftSum + rightSum
    
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum)
    
    return currentNode.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum)
  }
  
  findAPath(root)
  
  return maxSum 
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N^2)`, where `‘N’` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take `O(N)`), and for every leaf node, we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take `O(N)`.
  - We can calculate a tighter time complexity of `O(NlogN)` from the space complexity discussion below.
- If we ignore the space required for the `allPaths` list, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst-case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
