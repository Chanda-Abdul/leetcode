# 124. üîéüë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

A <b>path</b> in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence <b>at most once</b>. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The <b>path sum</b> of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum <b>path sum</b> of any path.

## Example 1:

````js
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

## Example 2:

````js
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Approach 1: Recursion
### Intuition

First of all, let's simplify the problem and implement a `maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode)` which takes a `node` as an argument and computes a maximum contribution that this `node` and one/zero of its subtrees could add.

> In other words, it's a maximum gain one could have including the node (and maybe one of its subtrees) into the path.

Hence if one would know for sure that the max path contains `root`, the problem would be solved as `maxPathSumRecursive(root)`. Unfortunately, the max path does not need to go through the `root`, and here is an example of such a tree

![](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/Figures/124/124_max_path.png)
That means one needs to modify the above function and to check at each step what is better
- to continue the current path 
- <b>OR</b> to start a new path with the current node as a highest node in this new path.

### Algorithm

Now everything is ready to write down an algorithm.
- Initiate `maxSum` as the smallest possible integer and call `maxPathSumRecursive(node = root)`.
- Implement `maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode)` with a check to continue the old path/to start a new path:
- <b>Base case</b> : if `node` is null, the `maxSum` is `0`.
- Call `maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode)` recursively for the node children to compute `maxSum` from the `left` and `right subtrees` : `leftSum = Math.max(0, maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode.left))` and
- `rightSum = Math.max(0, maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode.right))`right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0).
- Now check to continue the old path or to start a new path. To start a new path would cost `currentSum = currentNode.val + leftSum + rightSum;`. Update `maxSum` if it's better to start a new path.
- For the recursion return the `axPathSumRecursive` the node and one/zero of its subtrees could add to the `currentNode.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum)`.

````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.right = right;
    this.left = left;
  }
}

function maxPathSum(root) {
  //Depth First Search => Recursion

  // Initialize to a very small number to handle a path of negative values
  let maxSum = -Infinity;

  maxPathSumRecursive(root);

  return maxSum;

  function maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode) {
    if (!currentNode) return 0;

    //traverse the left sub tree
    let leftSum = Math.max(0, maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode.left));
    //traverse the right sub tree
    let rightSum = Math.max(0, maxPathSumRecursive(currentNode.right));

    //find current sum
    let currentSum = currentNode.val + leftSum + rightSum;

    //if currentSum > maxSum update
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);

    return currentNode.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum);
  }
}

let root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
console.log(`Maximum Path Sum: ${maxPathSum(root)}`); 
//6, The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

root = new TreeNode(-10);
root.left = new TreeNode(9);
root.right = new TreeNode(20);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(15);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(7);
console.log(`Maximum Path Sum: ${maxPathSum(root)}`); 
// 42, The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

## Complexity Analysis
- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N^2)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take `O(N)`), and for every leaf node, we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take `O(N)`.
  - We can calculate a tighter <b>time complexity</b> of `O(N log N)` from the <b>space complexity</b> discussion below.
- If we ignore the <b>space</b> required for the `allPaths` list, the <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This <b>space</b> will be used to store the <i>recursion stack</i>. The worst-case will happen when the given tree is a <i>linked list</i> (i.e., every node has only one child).
