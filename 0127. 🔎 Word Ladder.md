# 127. ðŸ”Ž Word Ladder
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

A transformation sequence from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s[1] -> s[2] -> ... -> s[k]` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `s[i]` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `s[k] == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists.

 

## Example 1:
````
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```` 

## Constraints:

- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i] `consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are unique.

## Solution 
````js
function ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList) {
  const wordSet = new Set(wordList);
  let queue = [beginWord];
  let steps = 1;

  while (queue.length) {
    const next = [];

    //loop over each word in the queue
    for (let word of queue) {
      if (word === endWord) return steps;

      //loop over each char of the word
      for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        //replace the char with letters from a-z
        for (let j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
          const newWord =
            word.slice(0, i) + String.fromCharCode(j + 97) + word.slice(i + 1);
          // console.log(newWord)
          //if the new word exists in the wordList add it to the queue
          if (wordSet.has(newWord)) {
            next.push(newWord);
            wordSet.delete(newWord);
          }
          // console.log(next)
        }
      }
    }
    queue = next;
    steps++;
  }

  // console.log(wordSet, queue);
  return 0;
}

ladderLength('hit', 'cog', ['hot', 'dot', 'dog', 'lot', 'log', 'cog']);
//Output: 5
//One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

ladderLength('hit', 'cog', ['hot', 'dot', 'dog', 'lot', 'log']);
//0
//The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
