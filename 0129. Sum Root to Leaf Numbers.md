# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

## Example 1:
````
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
`````
 

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

## My Solution
````
function sumNumbers (root) {
    return findRootToLeafPathNumbers(root, 0)
};

function findRootToLeafPathNumbers(currentNode, pathSum) {
    if(currentNode === null) return 0
    
    //calculate the path number of the current node
    pathSum = 10 * pathSum + currentNode.val
    
    //if the currentNode is a leaf, return the current pathSum
    if(currentNode.left === null && currentNode.right === null) return pathSum
    
    //recursively traverse the left and the right sub-tree
    return findRootToLeafPathNumbers(currentNode.left, pathSum) + findRootToLeafPathNumbers(currentNode.right, pathSum)
}
````
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `â€˜Nâ€™` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
