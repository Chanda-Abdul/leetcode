## 136. ðŸ˜• Single Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

Given a <b>non-empty</b> array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

## Follow up 
- [x] Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

## Example 1:

##### Input: `nums = [2,2,1]`
##### Output: `1`

## Example 2:

##### Input: `nums = [4,1,2,1,2]`
##### Output: `4`

## Example 3:
##### Input: `nums = [1]`
##### Output: `1`

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## Solution 

````
function singleNumber(nums) {
  //So we can XOR all the numbers in the input
  //duplicate numbers will zero out each other and we will be left with the single number.
  let num = 0
  
  for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    num ^= nums[i]
  }
  return num
}
````

## Time  & Space Complexity

- Time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` as we iterate through all numbers of the input once.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
