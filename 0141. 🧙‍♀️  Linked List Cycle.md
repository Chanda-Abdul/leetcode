# 141. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Linked List Cycle
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. <b>Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter</b>.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Example 1

````
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
````

## Example 2
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
````
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
````

## Example 3
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
````
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
````

## Constraints
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

## Follow up
- [x] Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution
### Approach 2: Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
#### Intuition

Imagine two runners running on a track at different speed. What happens when the track is actually a circle?

### Algorithm

The space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)` by considering two pointers at different speed - a `slow` pointer and a `fast` pointer. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.

If there is no cycle in the list, the `fast` pointer will eventually reach the end and we can return `false` in this case.

Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the `slow` and `fast` pointers are two runners racing around a circle track. The `fast` runner will eventually meet the `slow` runner. Why? Consider this case (we name it case A) - The `fast` runner is just one step behind the `slow` runner. In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.

How about other cases? For example, we have not considered cases where the `fast` runner is two or three steps behind the `slow` runner yet. This is simple, because in the next or next's next iteration, this case will be reduced to case A mentioned above.

````
class ListNode {
  constructor(val, next = null) {
    this.value = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;

  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    fast = fast.next.next;
    slow = slow.next;

    if (slow === fast) {
      //found the cycle
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}

let head = new ListNode(3);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(0);
head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
head.next.next.next.next = head.next;
hasCycle(head);

head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = head;
hasCycle(head);

head = new ListNode(1);
hasCycle(head);

````

## Time & Space Complexity
- Once the slow pointer enters the cycle, the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer in the same loop. Therefore, the time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.To analyze its time complexity, we consider the following two cases separately.
  - <b>List has no cycle</b>:
  
  The fast pointer reaches the end first and the run time depends on the list's length, which is `O(n)`.
  - <b>List has a cycle</b>:
  
  We break down the movement of the `slow` pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:
  
  1. The `slow` pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the `fast` pointer has already reached the cycle. `Number of iterations=non-cyclic length=N`
  2. Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the `fast` runner moves 2 steps while the `slow` runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is `1`, it takes `distance between the 2 runners/difference of speed`loops for the `fast` runner to catch up with the `slow` runner. As the distance is at most `cyclic length K` and the speed difference is `1`, we conclude that
`Number of iterations=almost cyclic length K`.
Therefore, the worst case time complexity is `O(N+K)`, which is `O(n)`.


- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)` because we only use two nodes (`slow` and `fast`).
