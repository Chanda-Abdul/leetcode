# 141. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Linked List Cycle
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. <b>Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter</b>.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Example 1
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
````
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
````

## Example 2
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
````
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
````

## Example 3
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
````
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
````

## Constraints
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

## Follow up
- [x] Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## My Solution
````
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let slow = head
    let fast = head
    
    while(fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        
        if(slow === fast) {
            //found the cycle
            return true
        }
    }
    
    return false
    
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- Once the slow pointer enters the cycle, the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer in the same loop. Therefore, the time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `‚ÄòN‚Äô` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
