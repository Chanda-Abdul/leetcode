# 143. Reorder List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
````
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
````
Reorder the list to be on the following form:
````
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
````
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
````
### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
 ````

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution 
````
function reorderList(head) {
    if(head === null || head.next === null) {
    return true
  }
  
  //find the middle of the LinkedList
  let slow = head
  let fast = head
  
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
  }
  
  //slow is now pointing to the middle node
  headSecondHalf = reverse(slow)
  //reverse thesecond half
  headFirstHalf = head
  
  //rearrange to produce the LinkList in the required order
  while(headFirstHalf !== null && headSecondHalf !== null) {
    let temp = headFirstHalf.next
    headFirstHalf.next = headSecondHalf
    headFirstHalf = temp
    
    temp = headSecondHalf.next
    headSecondHalf.next = headFirstHalf
    headSecondHalf = temp
  }
  
  //set the next of the last node to 'null'
  if(headFirstHalf!== null) {
    headFirstHalf.next = null
  } 
};

function reverse(head) {
  let prev = null
  
  while(head !== null) {
    let next = head.next
    head.next = prev
    prev = head
    head = next
  }
  
  return prev 
}
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm will have a time complexity of `O(N)` where `‘N’` is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
