# 153.👩🏽‍🦯 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. <b>Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter</b>.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Example 1
````
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
````

## Example 2
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
````
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
````

## Example 3
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
````
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
````

## Constraints
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

## Solution
````js
function findMin(nums) {
  let start = 0;
  let end = nums.length - 1;

  while (start < end) {
    let mid = Math.floor(start + (end- start) / 2);
    //if mid > end, minValue should be in second half
    if (nums[mid] > nums[end]) {
      start = mid + 1;
    } else {
      //else mid < end, minValue should be in first half
      end = mid;
    }
  }
      
  return nums[start];
}


findMin([2,1])//1
findMin([3,4,5,1,2])//1
//The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
findMin([4,5,6,7,0,1,2])
//0
//The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

findMin( [11,13,15,17])
//11
//The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
````

## Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
