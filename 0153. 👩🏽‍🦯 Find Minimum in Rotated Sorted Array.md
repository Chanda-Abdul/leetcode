# 153.👩🏽‍🦯 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is <b>rotated</b> between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that <b>rotating</b> an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of <b>unique</b> elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

## Example 1
````
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
````

## Example 2
````
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
````

## Example 3
````
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
````

## Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are <b>unique</b>.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

## Solution
````js
function findMin(nums) {
  let start = 0;
  let end = nums.length - 1;

  while (start < end) {
    let mid = Math.floor(start + (end- start) / 2);
    //if mid > end, minValue should be in second half
    if (nums[mid] > nums[end]) {
      start = mid + 1;
    } else {
      //else mid < end, minValue should be in first half
      end = mid;
    }
  }
      
  return nums[start];
}


findMin([2,1])
//1

findMin([3,4,5,1,2])
//1
//The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

findMin([4,5,6,7,0,1,2])
//0
//The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

findMin( [11,13,15,17])
//11
//The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
````

## Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
