# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters/

Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.
## Example 1:
#### Input: `s = "eceba"`
#### Output: `3`
#### Explanation: `The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `s = "ccaabbb"`
#### Output: `5`
#### Explanation: `The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.`
 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of English letters.
## Solution
````
function lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(s) {
    let windowStart = 0
    let maxLength = 0
    let charFreq = {}
  
    //try to extend the range
    for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length; windowEnd++) {
        const endChar = s[windowEnd]
        
        if(!(endChar in charFreq)) {
            charFreq[endChar] = 0
        }
        charFreq[endChar]++
      
      //shrink the sliding window, until we are left
      //with 2 chars in charFreq hashMap
      
      while(Object.keys(charFreq).length > 2) {
        const startChar = s[windowStart]
        charFreq[startChar]--
        if(charFreq[startChar] === 0) {
          delete charFreq[startChar]
        }
        windowStart++
      }
      maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1)
    }
    
    return maxLength
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm’s time complexity will be `O(N)`, where `‘N’` is the number of characters in the input array. The outer `for` loop runs for all characters, and the inner `while` loop processes each character only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be `O(N+N)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)` as there can be a maximum of twenty-six chars stored in the frequency map.
