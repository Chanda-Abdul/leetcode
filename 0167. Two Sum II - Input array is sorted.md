# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function `twoSum` should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where `index1` must be less than `index2`.

Note:

- Your returned answers (both `index1` and `index2`) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
 

## Example 1:
````
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
````

## Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in increasing order.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

## Solution 
````
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  let i = 0
  let j = numbers.length-1
  
  while(numbers[i] + numbers[j] !== target) {
    if(numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target) {
      j--
    }
    else {
      i++
    }
  }
  
  return [i+1, j+1]
}

twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9)//[1,2], The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
twoSum([2,3,4],6)//[1,3],The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
twoSum([-1,0], -1)//[1,2], The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in the given array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
