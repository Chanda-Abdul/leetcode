# 167. Two Sum II
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

Given a <b>1-indexed</b> array of integers numbers that is already sorted in <b>non-decreasing order</b>, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, <b>added by one</b> as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length `2`.

The tests are generated such that there is <b>exactly one solution</b>. You <b>may not</b> use the same element twice.



## Example 1:
````
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
````

## Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in increasing order.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

## Solution 
````
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  let start = 0
  let end = nums.length-1
  
  while(start < end) {
    let sum = nums[start] + nums[end]
    if(sum === target) {
      return [start + 1, end + 1]
    } else if(sum < target) {
      start++
    } else {
      end--
    }
  }
  
  return [-1, -1]   
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity is `O(n)` because The input array is traversed at most once. 
- The Space complexity is `O(1)`. We only use additional space to store two indices and the sum, so the space complexity is `O(1)`.
