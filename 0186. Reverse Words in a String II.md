# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/

Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem <b>in-place</b>, i.e. without allocating extra space.

 

## Example 1:
#### Input: `s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]`
#### Output: `["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `s = ["a"]`
#### Output: `["a"]`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.
- `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

## Solution
````
function reverseWords(s) {
  //in-place
  let start = 0
  let end = s.length -1
 
  reverseOneWord(start, end, s)
 
  end = 0

   while(start < s.length){
     
     while(s[end] !== " " && end < s.length) {
       end++
     }
     reverseOneWord(start, end-1)
     start = end + 1
     end = start   
  }
  
  return s
  
  //helper function
  function reverseOneWord(start, end) {
    
    while(start < end) {
    let temp = s[start]
    s[start] = s[end]
    s[end] = temp
    start++
    end--
    }
  }
  
};

reverseWords(["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"])
````

## Time-Complexity
- The algorithm above runs in `O(n)` time
- The algorithm above uses `O(1)` space because the array is rearranged <b>in-place</b>
