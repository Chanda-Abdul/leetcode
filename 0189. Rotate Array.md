# 189. Rotate Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explination: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
````

## Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]`
Explination: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
````

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`


## Solution #1 `Two-Pointer`
````
function rotate(nums, k) {
  // ðŸ˜• if k > nums.length then one cycle is completed that means it 
  // will remain the same and we have to remainder shifts
  k %= nums.length

  
  function reverse(start, end) {
    while(start < end) {
      [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]]
    start++
    end--
    }
  }
  
  //reverse the entire array
  //[ 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
  reverse(0, nums.length-1)
  
  //reverse the first part of the array before index k
  reverse(0, k-1)
  //[ 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
  
  //reverse the second part of the array starting at index k
  reverse(k, nums.length-1)
  
  
  console.log(nums)
};

rotate([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 3)//[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
//rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
//rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
//rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
rotate([-1,-100,3,99], 2)//[3,99,-1,-100]
//rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
//rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
````

## Time & Space Complexity

- This algorithm has a linear time complexity of `O(N)`
- This algorithm runs in constant space of `O(1)`.

## Follow up:
- [ ] Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- [x] Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

## Solution #2

````
function rotate(nums, k) {
  //Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
  for(let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    nums.unshift(nums.pop())
  }
  
  console.log(nums)
};

rotate([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 3)//[ 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
rotate([-1,-100,3,99], 2)//[ 3, 99, -1, -100 ]
