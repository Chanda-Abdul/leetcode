# 199. 👩🏽‍🦯 Binary Tree Right Side View
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the `right` side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/14/tree.jpg)
````js
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: root = [1,null,3]
Output: [1,3]
````
## Example 3:
````js
Input: root = []
Output: []
````
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution 
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function rightSideView (root) {
    if(root === null) { 
        return []
    }
    
    let result = []
    
    let queue = [root]
    
    while(queue.length) {
        let levelSize = queue.length
        
        for(let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            let currentNode = queue.shift()
            
            //if this is the last node of the currentLevel add it to result
            if(i === levelSize - 1){
                result.push(currentNode.val)
            }
            
            //insert the children of the currentNode into the queue
            if(currentNode.left !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.left)
            }
            if(currentNode.right !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.right)
            }
        }
    }   
    return result    
};

let root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(4);
rightSideView(root);

root = new TreeNode(1)
root = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
rightSideView(root);

root = null
rightSideView(root);

## Complexity Analysis
- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once
- The <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the <i>queue</i>. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` <b>space</b> to store them in the <i>queue</i>.
