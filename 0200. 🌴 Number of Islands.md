# 200. ðŸŒ´ Number of Islands ðŸŒ´
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An <b>island</b> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example 1:
````
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
],

Output :
1
````
## Example 2:
````
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
],

Output :
3
````

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
````
function explore(row, col, grid) {
  //helper function, in grid with "1", turns it into a "0"
  //and DFS any of the left, right, up, down "1"'s
  //return if
  //row < 0 OR colo < 0 OR row is out of bounds(the row is larger than the number of arrays in the 2d array) OR col is at/out of bounds(the current col is at/over the number of elements a row has)
  if(row < 0 || col < 0 || row >= grid.length || col >= grid[row].length || grid[row][col] === '0'){
    return
  }
  //else, we should go exploring
  //first set the current spot to "0"
  grid[row][col] = "0"
  //case 1: 1 to the right, left, top, bottom
  //right 
  explore(row, col+1, grid)
  //left
  explore(row, col-1, grid)
  //up
  explore(row+1, col, grid)
  //down
  explore(row-1, col, grid)
}

function numIslands(grid) {
  let islandCount = 0
  //go through each cell of the 2d array/grid
  for(let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
    for(let col = 0; col < grid[row].length; col++) {
      if(grid[row][col] == "1") {
        islandCount++
        explore(row, col, grid)
      }
    }
  }
  return islandCount    
};
