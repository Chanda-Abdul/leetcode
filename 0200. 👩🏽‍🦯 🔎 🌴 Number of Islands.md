# 200. 👩🏽‍🦯 🔎 🌴 Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

> Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `1`'s (land) and `0`'s (water), return the number of islands.

An <b>island</b> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example 1:
````
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]])

Output : 1
````
## Example 2:
````
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]])

Output : 3
````

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
````js
function numIslands(grid) {
  let islands = 0
  
  //go through each cell of the grid, and DFS
  for(let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
    for(let j = 0; j< grid[i].length; j++){
      if(grid[i][j] === '1'){
        islands++
        dfs(i, j)
      }
    }
  }
  
  function dfs(row, col){
    //in grid with "1", turns it into a "0"
    if(grid[row][col] === '1'){
      grid[row][col] = '0'
    } else {
      return
    }
    
    //else, we should go "exploring" in DFS manner
    //any of the left, right, up, down 1's(n-ary tree)
    //return if
    //row is out of bounds(row < 0 )
    // OR col is at/out of bounds(col < 0 )
  
    //down
    if(row < grid.length-1){
      dfs(row + 1, col)
    }
    //up
    if(row > 0 && row < grid.length){
      dfs(row - 1, col)
    }
    //right
    if(col < grid[row].length -1){
      dfs(row, col + 1)
    }
    //left
    if(col > 0 && col < grid[row].length){
      dfs(row, col - 1)
    } 
  }
  return islands
}

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity of `O(M×N)` where `M` is the number of rows and `N` is the number of columns.
- Space complexity in the worst case is `O(M×N)` in case that the grid map is filled with lands where `DFS` goes by `M×N` deep.
