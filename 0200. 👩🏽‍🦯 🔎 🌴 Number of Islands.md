# 200. 👩🏽‍🦯 🔎 🌴 Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

> Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `1`'s (land) and `0`'s (water), return the number of islands.

An <b>island</b> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example 1:
````js
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]])

Output : 1
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]])

Output : 3
````

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
````js
function numIslands(grid) {
  let islands = 0;

  //go through each cell of the grid, and DFS to find islands
  for (let rows = 0; rows < grid.length; rows++) {
    for (let cols = 0; cols < grid[0].length; cols++) {
      if (grid[rows][cols] === '1') {
        islands++;
        dfs(rows, cols);
      }
    }
  }

  function dfs(row, col) {
    //in grid where "1", turns it into a "0"
    if (grid[row][col] === '1') {
      grid[row][col] = '0';
    } else {
      return;
    }

    //else, we should go "exploring" in DFS manner
    //any of the left, right, up, down 1's(n-ary tree)
    //return if
    //row is out of bounds(row < 0 )
    // OR col is at/out of bounds(col < 0 )

    //check up
    if (row < grid.length - 1) {
      dfs(row + 1, col);
    }
    //check down
    if (row > 0 && row < grid.length) {
      dfs(row - 1, col);
    }
    // check right
    if (col < grid[row].length - 1) {
      dfs(row, col + 1);
    }
    // check left
    if (col > 0 && col < grid[row].length) {
      dfs(row, col - 1);
    }
  }

  return islands;
}


numIslands(
  grid = [
    ['1', '1', '1', '1', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '1', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],
  ]
);
// Output: 1

numIslands(
  grid = [
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1'],
  ]
);
// Output: 3

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity of `O(M×N)` where `M` is the number of rows and `N` is the number of columns.
- Space complexity in the worst case is `O(M×N)` in case that the grid map is filled with lands where `DFS` goes by `M×N` deep.
