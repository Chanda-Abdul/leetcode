# 200. ðŸ”Ž  ðŸŒ´ Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An <b>island</b> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example 1:
````
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
],

Output : 1
````
## Example 2:
````
Input :
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
],

Output : 3
````

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
````
function numIslands(grid) {
  let islands = 0;

  //in grid with "1", turns it into a "0"
  //and DFS any of the left, right, up, down "1"'s
  //return if
  //row < 0 OR colo < 0 OR row is out of bounds(the row is larger than the number of arrays in the 2d array) OR col is at/out of bounds(the current col is at/over the number of elements a row has)
  
  function dfs(column, row) {
    if (grid[column][row] === '1') {
      grid[column][row] = '0';
    } else {
      return;
    }
    
    //else, we should go exploring
    if (column < grid.length - 1) {
      dfs(column + 1, row);
    }

    if (row < grid[column].length - 1) {
      dfs(column, row + 1);
    }
    if (column > 0 && column < grid.length) {
      dfs(column - 1, row);
    }
    if (row > 0 && row < grid[column].length) {
      dfs(column, row - 1);
    }
  }

  //go through each cell of the grid, and DFS
  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
      if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
        islands++;
        dfs(i, j);
      }
    }
  }

  return islands;
}

numIslands([
  ['1', '1', '1', '1', '0'],
  ['1', '1', '0', '1', '0'],
  ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
  ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],
]); //1
numIslands([
  ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
  ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
  ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0'],
  ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1'],
]); //3

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time complexity of `O(MÃ—N)` where `M` is the number of rows and `N` is the number of columns.
- Space complexity in the worst case is `O(MÃ—N)` in case that the grid map is filled with lands where `DFS` goes by `MÃ—N` deep.
