> Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A <b>happy number</b> is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it <b>loops endlessly</b> in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process <b>ends in 1</b> are happy.
Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

## Example 1:

#### Input: `n = 19`
#### Output: `true`
#### Explanation:
1² + 9² = 82

8² + 2² = 68

6² + 8² = 100

1² + 0² + 0² = 1
## Example 2:

#### Input: `n = 2`
#### Output: `false`
 

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

## My Solution
````
function isHappy(n) {
    let slow = n
    let fast = n
    
    while(true) {
        //move one step
        slow = findSquareSum(slow)
        //move two steps
        fast = findSquareSum(findSquareSum(fast))
        
        if(slow === fast) {
            //found the cycle
            break
        }
    }
    //see if the cycle is stuck on the number 1
    return slow === 1  
};

function findSquareSum(num) {
    let sum = 0
    while(num > 0) {
        //num = 89
        let digit = num % 10
        //digit = 9
        sum += digit * digit
        //sum += 81
        num = Math.floor(num/10)
        //89 = 8
    }
    return sum
}

## Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is difficult to determine. However we know the fact that all unhappy numbers eventually get stuck in the cycle: 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89 -> 145 -> 42 -> 20 -> 4

This sequence behavior tells us two things:
1. If the number `N` is less than or equal to 1000, then we reach the cycle or ‘1’ in at most 1001 steps.
2. For `N > 1000`, suppose the number has `‘M’` digits and the next number is `‘N1’`. From the above Wikipedia link, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits of `‘N’` is at most 9²M, or `81M`(this will happen when all digits of `‘N’` are `‘9’`).

This means:
1. `N1 < 81M`
2. As we know `M = log(N+1)`
3. Therefore: `N1 < 81 * log(N+1) => N1 = O(logN)`
- This concludes that the above algorithm will have a time complexity of `O(logN)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
