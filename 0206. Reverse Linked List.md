# 206. Reverse Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`
#### Output: `[5,4,3,2,1]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `head = [1,2]`
#### Output: `[2,1]`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `head = []`
#### Output: `[]`
 

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

## My Solution(Iterative)
````
function reverseList(head) {
    let current = head
    let previous = null
    
    while(current !== null) {
        //temporarily store the next node
        next = current.next
        //reverse the current node
        current.next = previous
        //before we move to the next node
        //point previous to the current node
        previous = current
        //move on to the next node
        current = next
    }
    
    return previous
};
````

## Follow up
- [ ] A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
