# üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø üå¥ 207. Course Schedule
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a[i], b[i]]` indicates that you must take course `b[i]` first if you want to take course `a[i]`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.
Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Example 1:
````js
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a[i], b[i] < numCourses`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are unique.

## Solution 
````js
function canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites) {
  const schedule = []
  
  if(numCourses.length <= 0) return false
  
  //1. Initialize the graph
  //count incoming edges
  const steps = Array(numCourses).fill(0)
  //adjacency list graph
  const graph = Array(numCourses).fill(0).map(()=>Array())
  
  
  //2. Build the graph
  prerequisites.forEach((prereq) => {
    let parent = prereq[0]
    let child = prereq[1]
    
    //put the child into it's parent's list
    graph[parent].push(child)
    
    //increment childs step
    steps[child]++
  })
  
  
  //3. Find all sources with 0 steps
  const sources = []
  for(let i = 0; i < steps.length; i++){
    if(steps[i] === 0) sources.push(i)
  }
  
  //4. For each source all it to the schedule and decrement it's children's steps
  //if a child becomes 0, add it to the source queue
  while(sources.length > 0){
    const vertex = sources.shift()
    schedule.push(vertex)
    graph[vertex].forEach(child => {
      //get the nodes children to decrement thier steps
      steps[child]--
      if(steps[child] === 0)sources.push(child)
    })
  }
  console.log(sources, steps, graph, schedule)
  
  //if schedule does not contain all courses,
  //there is a cyclic dependency between courses,
  //therefore, we will not be able to schedule all courses
 return schedule.length === numCourses ? true : false
    
};


canFinish(2, [[1,0]])
//true
//There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
//To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

canFinish(2, [[1,0],[0,1]])
//false, 
//There are a total of 2 courses to take
//To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
//The tasks have a cyclic dependency, therefore they cannot be scheduled.

canFinish(3, [[0, 1], [1, 2]])
//To execute task '1', task '0' needs to finish first. 
//Similarly, task '1' needs to finish before '2' can be scheduled. 
//One possible scheduling of tasks is: [0, 1, 2] 

canFinish(3, [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]])
// []
//The tasks have a cyclic dependency, therefore they cannot be scheduled.

canFinish(6, [[2, 5], [0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 4], [3, 2], [1,3]])
// true
//A possible scheduling of tasks is: [0 1 4 3 2 5]

## Complexity Analysis
- In step `4`, each `course` can become a source only once, and each edge (i.e., `prereq`) will be accessed and removed once. Therefore, the <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(V+E)`, where `V` is the total number of courses and `E` is the total number of `prerequisites`.
- The <b>space complexity</b> will be `O(V+E)`, since we are storing all of the `prerequisites` for each task in an <b>adjacency list</b>.
