# üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø üå¥ 210. Course Schedule II
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a[i], b[i]]` indicates that you <b>must</b> take course `b[i]` first if you want to take course `a[i]`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return <b>any</b> of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, <b>return an empty array</b>.

## Example 1:
````js
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
````
## Example 3:
````js
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
````
## Constraints:
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a[i], b[i] < numCourses`
- `a[i] != b[i]`
- All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are <b>distinct</b>.

## Solution 
````js
function findOrder(numCourses, prerequisites) {
  let schedule = [];

  if (numCourses.length <= 0) return false;

  // 1. Initialize the graph
  // by counting incoming edges
  const steps = Array(numCourses).fill(0);
  //create adjaceny list graph
  const graph = Array(numCourses)
    .fill(0)
    .map(() => Array());

  // 2. Build the graph
 prerequisites.forEach((prereq) => {
    let parent = prereq[0];
    let child = prereq[1];

    //put the child in it's parents list
    graph[parent].push(child);
    //increment childs step
    steps[child]++;
  });

  // 3. Find all sources with 0 steps
  const sources = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < steps.length; i++) {
    if (steps[i] === 0) sources.push(i);
  }

  // 4. For each source, add it to schedule and decrements it's childrens steps
  while (sources.length > 0) {
    const vertex = sources.shift();

    schedule.unshift(vertex);

    graph[vertex].forEach((child) => {
      //get the nodes children to decrement thier steps
      steps[child]--;
      if (steps[child] === 0) sources.push(child);
    });
  }

  // if schedule doesnt contain all courses,
  // there is a cyclic dependency between courses,
  // therefore we will no be able to schedule all courses

  if (schedule.length !== numCourses) return [];
  // console.log(steps, graph, sources)

  return schedule;
}

findOrder((numCourses = 2), (prerequisites = [[1, 0]]));
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

findOrder(
  (numCourses = 4),
  (prerequisites = [
    [1, 0],
    [2, 0],
    [3, 1],
    [3, 2],
  ])
);
// Output: [0,2,1,3]
// Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
// So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

findOrder((numCourses = 1), (prerequisites = []));
// Output: [0]

## Complexity Analysis
- In step `4`, each `course` can become a source only once, and each edge (i.e., `prereq`) will be accessed and removed once. Therefore, the <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(V+E)`, where `V` is the total number of courses and `E` is the total number of `prerequisites`.
- The <b>space complexity</b> will be `O(V+E)`, since we are storing all of the `prerequisites` for each task in an <b>adjacency list</b>.
