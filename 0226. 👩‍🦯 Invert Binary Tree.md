# 👩‍🦯 226. Invert Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its `root`.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert1-tree.jpg)
````
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert2-tree.jpg)
````
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: root = []
Output: []
````
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## My Solution 
````
function invertTree(root) {
    if(root === null) return root
    
    let temp = root.left
    root.left = root.right
    root.right = temp
    
    invertTree(root.left)
    invertTree(root.right)
    
    return root  
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)` because we will vist each node once
- The space complexity is `O(1)` because we did not use any additional space
