# 235. üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow <b>a node to be a descendant of itself</b>).‚Äù

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
````
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
````
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

## Example 3:
````
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```` 

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are <b>unique</b>.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## Iterative Solution

````js
class TreeNode{
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null){
    this.val = val
    this.left = left
    this.right = right
  }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q){
    while(root){
      if(root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val){
        root = root.right
      }
      else if(root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val){
        root = root.left
      } else {
        break
      }
    }
  return root
};

let root = new TreeNode(6), p = new TreeNode(2), q = new TreeNode(8)
root.left = new TreeNode(2)
root.right = new TreeNode(8)
root.left.left = new TreeNode(0)
root.left.right = new TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = new TreeNode(7)
root.right.right = new TreeNode(9)
root.left.right.left = new TreeNode(3)
root.left.right.right = new TreeNode(5)
// lowestCommonAncestor(root, 2, 8)
lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q)
// 6
//The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.


lowestCommonAncestor(root, 2, 4)
// 2
// The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

root = new TreeNode(2) 
root.left = new TreeNode(1)
lowestCommonAncestor(root, 2, 1)
// 2

### Complexity Analysis
<!-- - The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `‚ÄòN‚Äô` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`. -->

## Recursive Solution
````js
class TreeNode{
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null){
    this.val = val
    this.left = left
    this.right = right
  }
}
function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q){
    if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    }
    if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    }
    return root;
};

let root = new TreeNode(6), p = new TreeNode(2), q = new TreeNode(8)
root.left = new TreeNode(2)
root.right = new TreeNode(8)
root.left.left = new TreeNode(0)
root.left.right = new TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = new TreeNode(7)
root.right.right = new TreeNode(9)
root.left.right.left = new TreeNode(3)
root.left.right.right = new TreeNode(5)
// lowestCommonAncestor(root, 2, 8)
lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q)
// 6
//The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.


lowestCommonAncestor(root, 2, 4)
// 2
// The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

root = new TreeNode(2) 
root.left = new TreeNode(1)
lowestCommonAncestor(root, 2, 1)
// 2

### Complexity Analysis
<!-- - The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(n)`, assuming that `n` is the list's length.
- The space complexity of our algorithm is `O(n)`. The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. The recursion could go up to `n` levels deep. -->
