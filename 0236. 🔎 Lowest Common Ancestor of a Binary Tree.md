# 236. üîé Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, find the <b>lowest common ancestor (LCA)</b> of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of <b>LCA</b> on Wikipedia: <i>‚ÄúThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).‚Äù</i>

## Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)
````
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)
````
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

## Example 3:
````
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```` 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are unique.

## Solution 
First the given nodes `p` and `q` are to be searched in a <b>binary tree</b> and then their lowest common ancestor is to be found. We can resort to a normal tree traversal to search for the two nodes. Once we reach the desired nodes `p` and `q`, we can backtrack and find the <b>lowest common ancestor</b>.
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q) {

  function findAPathDFS(currentNode) {
    if (currentNode === null) return null;
   
    if(currentNode === p || currentNode === q){ 
      return currentNode
    }

    const pathToP = findAPathDFS(currentNode.left);
    const pathToQ = findAPathDFS(currentNode.right);
 
    return pathToP && pathToQ ? currentNode.value : pathToP || pathToQ
  }
  return findAPathDFS(root)
}

let root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(5);
root.right = new TreeNode(1);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(0);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(8);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(6);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
root.left.right.left = new TreeNode(7);
root.left.right.right = new TreeNode(4);
lowestCommonAncestor(root, 5, 1);
// 3
//The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

lowestCommonAncestor(root, 5, 4);
//5
//The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
lowestCommonAncestor(root, 1, 2);
//1

## Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree.
- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(N)`. This is because the maximum amount of space utilized by the recursion stack would be `N` since the height of a skewed binary tree could be `N`.
