# 238. Product of Array Except Self
https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Example 1:
````js
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
````
 

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

## Follow up:

- [x] Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and without using division?
- [x] Could you solve it with `O(1)` constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.

## My Solution
````js
function productExceptSelf(nums) {
  let n = nums.length;
  let result = Array(n).fill(1);
  let productFromStart = 1;
  let productFromEnd = 1;

  for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    //for each index, we find the products of all the
    //numbers before it, storing the product so far each time
    result[i] *= productFromEnd;
    productFromEnd *= nums[i];
    console.log(result[i], productFromEnd,result)
  }

  for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
    //for each index, we find the products of all the
    //numbers after it, storing the product so far each time
    result[j] *= productFromStart;
    productFromStart *= nums[j];
    console.log(result[j], productFromStart,result)
  }

  return result;
}

productExceptSelf([1, 2, 3, 4]); //[24,12,8,6]

productExceptSelf([-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]); //[0,0,9,0,0]

## Time and Space Complexity
`O(n)` time and `O(1)` space. We make two passes through our input an array, and the array we build always has the same length as the input array.
