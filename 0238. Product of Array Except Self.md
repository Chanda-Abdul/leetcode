# 238. Product of Array Except Self
#Greedy #Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Example 1:

#### Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
#### Output: `[24,12,8,6]`
## Example 2:

#### Input: `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
#### Output: `[0,0,9,0,0]`
 

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

## Follow up:

- Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and without using division?
- Could you solve it with `O(1)` constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## My Solution
````
function productExceptSelf(nums) {
    const productsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex = []
    
    //for each index, we find the products of all the
    //numbers before it, storing the product so far each time
    let productSofar = 1
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        productsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex[i] = productSofar
        productSofar *= nums[i]
    }
    
    //for each index, we find the products of all the
    //numbers after it, storing the product so far each time
    productSofar = 1
    for(let j = nums.length-1; j >= 0; j--) {
        productsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex[j] *= productSofar
        productSofar *= nums[j]
    }
    
    return productsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex
};

## Time and Space Complexity
`O(n)` time and `O(n)` space. We make two passes through our input an array, and the array we build always has the same length as the input array.
