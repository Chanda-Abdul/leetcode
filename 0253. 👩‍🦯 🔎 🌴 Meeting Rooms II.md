# 253. 👩‍🦯 🔎 🌴 Meeting Rooms II
https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

## Example 1:

````js
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
````

## Example 2:

````js
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
````

## My Solution 

````js
function minMeetingRooms(intervals) {
  // JavaScript does not come with built in Heap, so I used an array to keep track of rooms 
  // and sorted by end time at each call
  if(intervals==null) return 0
  if(intervals.length <= 1 ) return intervals.length
  
  //helper that returns the meeting room with the earliest end time
  function getEarliest(room) {
    room.sort((a, b) => a[1]-b[1])
    return rooms[0]
  }
  
  //sort intervals by start date
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])
  
  let rooms = [intervals[0]]
  
  for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    let earliestRoom = getEarliest(rooms)
    let currentTime = intervals[i];
    
    // if the room time ends before the currentTime interval starts
    //then use the room and update the room end time to currentTime
    if(earliestRoom[1] <= currentTime[0]) {
      earliestRoom[1] = currentTime[1]
    }
    else {
      //create room
      rooms.push(currentTime)
    }
  }
  
  return rooms.length
  
};

minMeetingRooms([[1,2]])
minMeetingRooms([[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]])//2
minMeetingRooms([[7,10],[2,4]])//1

## Heap Solution 
````js
const minMeetingRooms = (intervals) => {
    const   compareFunc = (a, b) => a - b,
            minHeap = new MinHeap(compareFunc);
    
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    let maxRooms = 0;
    
    intervals.forEach(interval => {
        if(minHeap.size > 0 && minHeap.peek() <= interval[0]) {
            minHeap.extract();
        }
        
        minHeap.insert(interval[1]);
        
        maxRooms = Math.max(maxRooms, minHeap.size);
    });
    
    return maxRooms;
};

// since JS does not have a native heap, 
// for an interview you can quickly code-up something like this
// letting interviewer know what you are doing
class MinHeap {
    constructor(compareFunc) {
        this.compareFunc = compareFunc;
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    insert(val) {
        this.heap.unshift(val);
        this.heap.sort(this.compareFunc);
    }
    
    extract() {
        if (this.size === 0) return null;
        return this.heap.shift();
    }
    
    peek() {
        if(this.size === 0) return null;
        return this.heap[0];
    }
    
    get size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }
}

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N*logN)`, where `‘N’` is the total number of meetings. This is due to the sorting that we did in the beginning. Also, while iterating the meetings we might need to poll/offer meeting to the priority queue. Each of these operations can take `O(logN)`. Overall our algorithm will take `O(NlogN)`.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for sorting. Also, in the worst case scenario, we’ll have to insert all the meetings into the Min Heap (when all meetings overlap) which will also take `O(N)` space. The overall space complexity of our algorithm is `O(N)`.
