# 257. Binary Tree Paths
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in <b>any order</b>.

A leaf is a <b>node</b> with no children.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/paths-tree.jpg)
````
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
````
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution
````
function binaryTreePaths(root) {
   let allPaths = []
   
   findAPath(root, [], allPaths)
   
   return allPaths
};

function findAPath(currentNode, currentPath, allPaths){
     if(currentNode === null) {
         return 
     }
    
    //add the currentNode to the path
    currentPath.push(currentNode.val)
    
    //if the currentNode is not a leaf, save the currentPath
    if(currentNode.left === null && currentNode.right === null) {
        allPaths.push(currentPath.join("->"))
    } else {
        //traverse the left sub-tree
        findAPath(currentNode.left, currentPath, allPaths)
        //traverse the right sub-tree
        findAPath(currentNode.right, currentPath, allPaths)
    }
    
    //remove the current node from the path to backtrack,
    //we need to remove the currentNode while we are going 
    //up the recursive call stack
    currentPath.pop()
}
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N^2)`, where `‘N’` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take `O(N)`), and for every leaf node, we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take `O(N)`.
  - We can calculate a tighter time complexity of `O(NlogN)` from the space complexity discussion below.
- If we ignore the space required for the `allPaths` list, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst-case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
