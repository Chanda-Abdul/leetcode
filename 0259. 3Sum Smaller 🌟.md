# 259. 3Sum Smaller

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-smaller/

Given an array of `n` integers `num`s and an integer `target`, find the number of index triplets `i`, `j`, `k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.



## Example 1:

#### Input: `nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2`
#### Output: `2`
#### Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than `2`:
`[-2,0,1]`
`[-2,0,3]`
## Example 2:

#### Input: `nums = [], target = 0`
#### Output: `0`
## Example 3:

#### Input: `nums = [0], target = 0`
#### Output: `0`
 

## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `0 <= n <= 300`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `-100 <= target <= 100`

## My Solution 
````
function threeSumSmaller (nums, target) {
    //sort the array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    let count = 0
    
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        count += searchPair(nums, target - nums[i], i)
    }
    return count  
};

function searchPair(arr, target, first){
    let count = 0
    let start = first + 1
    let end = arr.length -1
    
    while(start < end) {
        if(arr[start] + arr[end] < target){
            //we found the a triplet
            //since arr[end] >= arr[start], therefore, we can replace arr[end]
            //by any number between start and end to get a sum less than the targetSum
            count += end - start
            start++
        } else {
            //we need a pair with a smaller sum
            end--
        }
    }
    return count
}
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- Sorting the array will take `O(N * logN)`. The `searchPair()` will take `O(N)`. So, overall `searchTriplets()` will take `O(N * logN + N^2)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N^2)`.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.

## Follow up: Could you solve it in `O(n2)` runtime?
*Another simpler approach could be to check every triplet of the array with three nested loops and create a list of triplets that meet the required condition.*
