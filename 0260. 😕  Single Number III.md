# ðŸ˜• 260. Single Number III
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/

Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]`
#### Output: `[3,5]`
#### Explanation:  `[5, 3] is also a valid answer.`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `nums = [-1,0]`
#### Output: `[-1,0]`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `nums = [0,1]`
#### Output: `[1,0]`
 
## Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.

## Solution
````
function singleNumber(nums) {
    //get the XOR of all the numbers
    let n1xn2 = 0
    nums.forEach((num) => {
        n1xn2 ^= num
    })
    
    //get the rightmost bit that is 1
    let rightmostSetBit = 1
    while((rightmostSetBit & n1xn2) === 0) {
        rightmostSetBit = rightmostSetBit << 1
        //The left shift operator ( << ) shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the left
        //Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. 
        //Zero bits are shifted in from the right.
    }
    let num1 = 0
    let num2 = 0
    
    nums.forEach((num) => {
        //if the bit is set
        if((num & rightmostSetBit) !== 0) {
            num1 ^= num
        } else {
            //the bit is set
            num2 ^= num
        }
    })
    return [num1, num2]
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
