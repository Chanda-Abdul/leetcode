# 268. Missing Number
###### https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/ 

Given an array nums containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Example 1:

#### Input: `nums = [3,0,1]`
#### Output: `2`
#### Explanation: 
`n = 3` since there are `3` numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,3]`. `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
## Example 2:
#### Input:` nums = [0,1]`
#### Output: `2`
#### Explanation: 
`n = 2` since there are `2` numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,2]`. `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
## Example 3:
#### Input: `nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`
#### Output: `8`
#### Explanation: 
`n = 9` since there are `9` numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,9]`. `8` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
## Example 4:
#### Input: `nums = [0]`
#### Output: `1`
#### Explanation: 
`n = 1` since there is `1` number, so all numbers are in the range `[0,1]`. `1` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

## My Solution
````
function missingNumber(nums) {
    let i = 0
    let n = nums.length
    
    //sort first
    while(i < n) {
        let j = nums[i]
        if(nums[i] < n && nums[i] !== nums[j]) {
            //swap 
            [nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[j], nums[i]]
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    
    //find the first number missing from it's index
    //that will be our required number
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(nums[i] !== i) {
            return i
        }
    }
    
    return n 
};

## Time & Space Complexity

- [x] Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only `O(1`) extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

  - The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`. In the while loop, although we are not incrementing the index `i` when swapping the numbers, this will result in more than `n` iterations of the loop, but in the worst-case scenario, the while loop will swap a total of `n-1` numbers and once a number is at its correct index, we will move on to the next number by incrementing `i`. In the end, we iterate the input array again to find the first number missing from its index, so overall, our algorithm will take `O(n) + O(n-1) + O(n)` which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(n)`.
  - The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
