# üë©‚Äçü¶Ø üòêüìñ  269. Alien Dictionary
https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings `words` from the alien language's dictionary, where the strings in `words` are <b>sorted lexicographically</b> by the rules of this new language.

Return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language <b>sorted in lexicographically increasing order</b> by the new language's rules. If there is no solution, return `""`. If there are multiple solutions, return <b>any of them</b>.

A string `s` is lexicographically smaller than a string `t` if at the first letter where they differ, the letter in `s` comes before the letter in `t` in the alien language. If the first `min(s.length, t.length)` letters are the same, then `s` is smaller if and only if `s.length < t.length`.


## Example 1:
````
Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: words = ["z","x"]
Output: "zx" 
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: words = ["z","x","z"]
Output: ""
Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution 
````js
function alienOrder(words) {
  // let dict = []
  if (words.length === 0) return '';
  // if(words.length === 1) return words[0]

  //1. Initialize graph
  //count of incoming edges
  const steps = {};
  //adjacency list
  const graph = {};

  words.forEach((word) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
      steps[word[i]] = 0;
      graph[word[i]] = [];
    }
  });

  //2. Build graph
  for(let i = 0; i < words.length-1; i++){
    let w1 = words[i]
    let w2 = words[i+1]
    
    //edge case
    if(w1.length > w2.length && w1.startsWith(w2)) return ''
    
    for(let j = 0; j < Math.min(w1.length, w2.length); j++){
      let parent = w1[j]
      let child = w2[j]
      
      //if the parent and child are different
      if(parent!== child){
        //put the child into it's parents list
        graph[parent].push(child)
        
        //increment childs steps
        steps[child]++
        
        //only the first different character between the
        //two word will help us find the order
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  //3. find all sources(vertices with 0 steps)
  const sources = []
  const chars = Object.keys(steps)
  chars.forEach(key => {
    if(steps[key] === 0) sources.push(key)
  })
  
  //4. For each source, add it to sortedDictionary and subtract 1 from all of it's children's steps
  //if a childs step becomes 0, add it to the source queue
  const sortedDictionary = []
  while(sources.length > 0){
    let vertex = sources.shift()
    sortedDictionary.push(vertex)
    graph[vertex].forEach(child=> {
      //get the node's children and decrement thier steps
      steps[child]--
      if(steps[child] === 0) sources.push(child)
    })
  }

  // console.log(sortedDictionary,sources, steps, graph);
  

  //if sortedDictionary does not contain all chars
  //then there is a cyclic dependency between chars
  //the we will not be able to find the correct ordering of chars
  return sortedDictionary.length !== chars.length ? '' : sortedDictionary.join("")
  
}

alienOrder(['abc', 'ab']);
//""
alienOrder(['wrt', 'wrf', 'er', 'ett', 'rftt']);
//"wertf"
alienOrder(['z', 'x']);
//"zx"
alienOrder(['z', 'x', 'z']);
//""
// The order is invalid, so return "".

## Time & Space Complexity
- In step <b>4</b>, each task can become a source only once and each edge (a rule) will be accessed and removed once. Therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(V+E)`, where `V` is the total number of different characters and `E` is the total number of the rules in the alien language. Since, at most, each pair of words can give us one rule, therefore, we can conclude that the upper bound for the rules is `O(N)`where `N` is the number of words in the input. So, we can say that the time complexity of our algorithm is `O(V+N)`.
- The space complexity will be `O(V+N)`, since we are storing all of the rules for each character in an <i>adjacency list</i>.
