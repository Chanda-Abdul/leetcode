# 278. 🔍 First Bad Version
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## Example 1:
````
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
````
## Constraints:
- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## My Solution
````js
 function isBadVersion(version) {
   return version >= bad
};



function solution (isBadVersion) {
    
    return function(n) {
        const start = 0
        const end = n
        
        //Binary Search
        while(end -start !== 1){
          let mid = Math.floor(start + (end-start) / 2);
        
          if(isBadVersion(mid)){
            // look on left side of mid
            end = mid
          } else {
            // look on the right side of mid
            start = mid
          }
        }
      return end
    };
};

let bad = 4
isBadVersion(3) 
  //-> false
isBadVersion(5) 
  //-> true
isBadVersion(4) 
  //-> true
// Then 4 is the first bad version.

bad = 1
isBadVersion(1) 
  //-> true

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity of `O(log(N))` because we used <b>Binary Search</b>
- Space Complexity is `O(N)`
