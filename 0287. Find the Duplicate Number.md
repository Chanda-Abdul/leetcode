# 287. Find the Duplicate Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in `nums`, return this repeated number.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `nums = [1,3,4,2,2]`
#### Output: `2`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `nums = [3,1,3,4,2]`
#### Output: `3`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `nums = [1,1]`
#### Output: `1`
## Example 4:
#### Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`
#### Output: `1`
 

## Constraints:
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 

## Follow up:

- [ ] How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- [ ] Can you solve the problem without modifying the array `nums`?
- [x] Can you solve the problem using only constant, `O(1)` extra space?
- [ ] Can you solve the problem with runtime complexity less than `O(n2)`?

## My Solution
````
function findDuplicate (nums) {
    let i = 0
    
    //we will try to place each number on its correct index. 
    //Since there is only one duplicate, if while swapping the number 
    //with its index both the numbers being swapped are same, we have found our duplicate!
    
    while(i < nums.length) {
        if(nums[i] !== i + 1) {
            let j = nums[i] - 1
            if(nums[i] !== nums[j]) {
                //swap
                [nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[j], nums[i]]
            } else {
                //we have found the duplicate
                return nums[i]
            }
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    return -1
    
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)` but modifies the input array.
