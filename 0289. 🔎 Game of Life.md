# 0289. ðŸ”Ž Game of Life
https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/

According to <b>Wikipedia's article</b>: <i>"<b>The Game of Life</b>, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."</i>

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: <b>live</b> (represented by a `1`) or <b>dead</b> (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (<b>horizontal</b>, <b>vertical</b>, <b>diagonal</b>) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any <b>live</b> cell with fewer than <i>two</i> <b>live</b> neighbors dies as if caused by <i>under-population</i>.
2. Any <b>live</b> cell with <i>two or three</i> <b>live</b> neighbors <i>lives on to the next generation</i>.
3. Any <b>live</b> cell with <i>more than three live</i> neighbors <i>dies</i>, as if by <i>over-population</i>.
4. Any <b>dead</b> cell with exactly <i>three</i> <b>live</b> neighbors becomes a <b>live</b> cell, as if by <i>reproduction</i>.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. 

> Given the current state of the `m x n` grid board, return the next state.


## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid1.jpg)
```js
Input: board = 
  [[0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]]
Output: 
  [[0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]]
```
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid2.jpg)
```js
Input: board = 
  [[1,1],
  [1,0]]
Output: 
  [[1,1],
  [1,1]]
```


## Constraints
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m`, `n <= 25`
- `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
## Solution 
```js
function gameOfLife(board) {
  if (board.length === 0) return board;

  function checkNeighbors(row, col) {
    let score = -board[row][col];
    // console.log(score);

    for (let r = row - 1; r <= row + 1; r++) {
      for (let c = col - 1; c <= col + 1; c++) {
        if (
          typeof board[r] !== 'undefined' &&
          typeof board[r][c] !== 'undefined'
        ) {
          score += Math.abs(Math.floor(board[r][c]));
        }
      }
    }
    return score;
  }

  for (let r = 0; r < board.length; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < board[0].length; c++) {
      let score = checkNeighbors(r, c);

      if (board[r][c] === 1) {
        // case 2: => 2-3 live neighbors
        // will still be 1, so continue

        if (score < 2 || score > 3) {
          // case 1: UP => < 2 live neighbors
          // case 3: OP => > 3 live neighbors
          board[r][c] = -0.5; //which would be 0 after Math.abs() and Math.ceil()
        }
      } else if (board[r][c] === 0) {
        if (score === 3) {
          // case 4: => 0 === 3 live neighbors
          board[r][c] = 0.5; // which would be 1 after Math.abs() and Math.ceil()
        }
      }
    }
  }

  for (let r = 0; r < board.length; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < board[0].length; c++) {
      board[r][c] = Math.ceil(board[r][c]);
    }
  }
  console.log(board);
}

gameOfLife(
  (board = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0],
  ])
);
// Output:
// [[0,0,0],
// [1,0,1],
// [0,1,1],
// [0,1,0]]

gameOfLife(
  (board = [
    [1, 1],
    [1, 0],
  ])
);
// Output:
//   [[1,1],
//   [1,1]]

```
### Complexity Analysis

- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(MÃ—N)`, where `M` is the number of <i>rows</i> and `N` is the number of <i>columns</i> of the `board`.
- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(1)`

## Follow up:

- [x] Could you solve it <b>in-place</b>? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.

In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?
