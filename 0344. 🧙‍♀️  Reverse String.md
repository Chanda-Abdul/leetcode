# 🧙‍♀️ 344. Reverse String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
## Example 1:
````
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
````

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.
 
## Follow up
- [x] Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Solution
````
function reverseString (s) {
   let i = 0
    let j = s.length-1
    
    while(i < j) {
        [s[i], s[j]] = [s[j], s[i]]
        i++
        j--
    }
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity

- The Time-complexity of the algorithm above is `O(N)` because we are iterating through the array `n/2` times, drop the constant of `/2` so it becomes `O(N)`
- The Space-Complexity of the algorithm above is `O(1)` because we modified the array in place without using additional space
