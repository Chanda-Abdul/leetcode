# üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 344. Reverse String(Strings)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
## Example 1:
#### Input: `["h","e","l","l","o"]`
#### Output: `["o","l","l","e","h"]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`
#### Output: `["h","a","n","n","a","H"]`

## My Solution
````
function reverseString (s) {
    //two-pointer
    let last = s.length - 1
    
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length/2; i++) {
        [s[i], s[last]] = [s[last], s[i]]
        last--
    }
    return s
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity

- The Time-complexity of the algorithm above is `O(N)` because we are iterating through the array `n/2` times, drop the constant of `/2` so it becomes `O(N)`
- The Space-Complexity of the algorithm above is `O(1)` because we modified the array in place without using additional space
