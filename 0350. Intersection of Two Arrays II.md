# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II
https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

## Example 1:

Input: `nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]`

Output: `[2,2]`
## Example 2:

Input: `nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]`

Output: `[4,9]`
#
<b>Note:</b>
- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.

<b>Follow up:</b>
- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## My Solution
````
const intersect = function(nums1, nums2) {
   const intersection = []
   const myMap = {}
   //fill the hashmap with the first array
   for(let i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
     if(myMap[nums1[i]]) {
       myMap[nums1[i]] += 1
     } else {
       myMap[nums1[i]] = 1
       }
     }
   
  //check the second array to see if the value is in the hashmap and then push it to the returning array
    for(let i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
      if(myMap[nums2[i]] > 0) {
        intersection.push(nums2[i])
        myMap[nums2[i]] -= 1
      }
    }
   return intersection
};

## Input
````
intersect([1,2,2,1], [2,2])
intersect([4,9,5], [9,4,9,8,4])
````

## Output
````
[ 2, 2 ]
[ 9, 4 ]
`````
