# 366. ðŸ”Ž Find Leaves of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
- Collect all the leaf nodes.
- Remove all the leaf nodes.
- Repeat until the tree is empty.
 
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/16/remleaves-tree.jpg)
````js
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers 
since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
````


## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function findLeaves(root) {  
  //recursively traverse in DFS to remove leaf nodes
  function collectAndRemoveLeaves(currentNode, results) {
    //base case
    if (currentNode === null) return null;

    //if there is no left or right subleaf
    //we have reached the end of the current branch, push the currentNode.val onto results
    if (currentNode.left === null && currentNode.right === null) {
      results.push(currentNode.val);
      return null;
    }

    //recursively check each left and right subtree
    currentNode.left = collectAndRemoveLeaves(currentNode.left, results);
    currentNode.right = collectAndRemoveLeaves(currentNode.right, results);
    return currentNode;
  }
  let results = [];
  
  //traverse to end of branches to find leaves
  while (root !== null) {
    let currentLeaves = [];
    root = collectAndRemoveLeaves(root, currentLeaves);
    results.push(currentLeaves);
  }

  return results;
}

let root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
findLeaves(root);

root = new TreeNode(1);
findLeaves(root);

## Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time Complexity</b>: Assuming `N` is the total number of nodes in the <b>binary tree</b>, traversing the tree takes `O(N)` <b>time</b> and storing all the pairs at the correct position also takes `O(N)` time. Hence overall time complexity of this approach is `O(N)`.
- <b>Space Complexity</b>: `O(N)`, the space used by `results` array.
