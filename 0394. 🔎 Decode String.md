# 394. ðŸ”Ž Decode String
https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_strin`g inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.
## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 30`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `'[]'`.
- `s` is guaranteed to be a valid input.
- All the integers in `s` are in the range `[1, 300]`.

## Solution 

### Approach 2: Using 2 Stack

In the previous approach, we used a single character stack to store the digits(`0-9`) as well as letters (`a-z`). We could instead maintain 2 separate stacks.

- `countStack`: The stack would store all the integer `k`.
- `stringStack`: The stack would store all the decoded strings.

Also, instead of pushing the decoded string to the stack character by character, we could improve our algorithm by appending all the characters into the string first and then push the entire string into the `stringStack`. 
### Algorithm

Iterate over the string `s` and process each character as follows:

- <b>Case 1</b>) If the current character is a digit `(0-9)`, append it to the number `k`.

- <b>Case 2)</b> If the current character is a letter `(a-z)`, append it to the `currentString`.

- <b>Case 3)</b> If current character is a opening bracket `[`, push `k` and `currentString` into `countStack` and `stringStack` respectively.

- <b>Case 4)</b> Closing bracket `]`: We must begin the decoding process,
  - We must decode the `currentString`. Pop `currentK` from the `countStack` and decode the pattern `currentK[currentString]`
  - As the `stringStack` contains the previously decoded string, pop the `decodedString` from the `stringStack`. Update the `decodedString = decodedString + currentK[currentString]`

````js
function decodeString(s) {
  let stack = [];
  let currStr = '';
  let currNum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] === '[') {
      stack.push(currStr);
      stack.push(currNum);
      currStr = '';
      currNum = 0;
    } else if (s[i] === ']') {
      // console.log(currStr, stack)
      let prevNum = stack.pop();
      let prevStr = stack.pop();
      currStr = prevStr + currStr.repeat(prevNum);
    } else if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
      currNum = currNum * 10 + Number(s[i]);
    } else {
      currStr += s[i];
    }
  }

  return currStr;
}

decodeString('3[a]2[bc]');
// "aaabcbc"

decodeString('3[a2[c]]');
//"accaccacc"
decodeString('2[abc]3[cd]ef');
//"abcabccdcdcdef"

### Time & Space Complexity Analysis

Assume, `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(maxK*n)`, where `maxK` is the maximum value of `k` and `n` is the length of a given string `s`. We traverse a string of size `n` and iterate `k` times to decode each pattern of form `k[string]`. This gives us worst case time complexity as `O(maxK*n)`.

- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(m+n)`, where `m` is the number of letters(`a-z`) and `n` is the number of digits(`0-9`) in string `s`. In worst case, the maximum size of `stringStack` and `countStack` could be `m` and `n` respectively.
