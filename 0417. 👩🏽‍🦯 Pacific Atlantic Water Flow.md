# 417. üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/

There is an` m x n` rectangular island that borders both the <b>Pacific Ocean</b> and <b>Atlantic Ocean</b>. The <b>Pacific Ocean</b> touches the island's left and top edges, and the <b>Atlantic Ocean</b> touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix heights where `heights[r][c]` represents the <b>height above sea level</b> of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is <b>less than or equal to</b> the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a <b>2D list</b> of grid coordinates result where `result[i] = [ri, ci]` denotes that rain water can flow from cell `(r[i], c[i])` to <b>both</b> the <b>Pacific</b> and <b>Atlantic oceans</b>.


## Example 1
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/waterflow-grid.jpg)
````
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
````
## Example 2
````

Input: heights = [[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
````

## Constraints

- `m == heights.length`
- `n == heights[r].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10^5`

## Solution - Depth First Search
Matrices such as this one are a type of graph representation. Standard graph traversal algorithms such as BFS and DFS can be used to solve this problem. 

The naive approach would be to check every cell - that is, iterate through every cell, and at each one, start a traversal that follows the problem's conditions. That is, find every cell that manages to reach both oceans.

This approach, however, is extremely slow, as it repeats a ton of computation. Instead of looking for every path from cell to ocean, let's start at the oceans and try to work our way to the cells. This will be much faster because when we start a traversal at a cell, whatever result we end up with can be applied to only that cell. However, when we start from the ocean and work backwards, we already know that every cell we visit must be connected to the ocean.

Intuitively, BFS makes more sense for this problem since water flows in the same manner. However, we can also use DFS, and it doesn't really make much of a difference. So, if you prefer DFS, then that's perfectly fine for this problem. Additionally, it's possible that your interviewer will ask you to implement the problem recursively instead of iteratively. Recursion must be DFS, not BFS.

### Algorithm

DFS is very similar to BFS. Instead of using a queue and working iteratively, we'll use recursion. Our dfs method will be called for every reachable cell. Note: we could also work iteratively with DFS, in which case we would simply use a stack instead of a queue like in the Approach 1 code, with mostly everything else being identical to the BFS approach.
