# 437. Path Sum III
https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)
````
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: 3
`````

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

## My Solution
````
function pathSum(root, targetSum) {
    let currentPath = []
    
    return countPathsRecursive(root, targetSum, currentPath)
    
};

function countPathsRecursive(currentNode, targetSum, currentPath) {
    if(currentNode === null) return 0
    
    
    //add the currentNode to the path
    currentPath.push(currentNode.val)
    
    let pathCount = 0
    let pathSum = 0
    
    //find the sums of all sub-paths in the current path list
    for(let i = currentPath.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        pathSum += currentPath[i]
        
        //if the sum of any sub-path is equal to targetSum we increment our path
        if(pathSum === targetSum) {
            pathCount++
        }
    }
    
    //traverse the left sub-tree
    pathCount += countPathsRecursive(currentNode.left, targetSum, currentPath)
    //traverse the right sub-tree
    pathCount += countPathsRecursive(currentNode.right, targetSum, currentPath)
    
    //remove the currentNode from the path to backtrack
    //we need to remove the currentNode while we are going up the recursive call stack
    currentPath.pop()
    return pathCount

}

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N²)` in the worst case, where `‘N’` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once, but for every node, we iterate the current path. The current path, in the worst case, can be `O(N)` (in the case of a skewed tree). But, if the tree is balanced, then the current path will be equal to the height of the tree, i.e., `O(logN)`. So the best case of our algorithm will be `O(NlogN)`.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child). We also need `O(N)` space for storing the currentPath in the worst case.  Overall space complexity of our algorithm is `O(N)`.
