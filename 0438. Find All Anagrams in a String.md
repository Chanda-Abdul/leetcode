# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

 

## Example 1:
#### Input: `s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"`
#### Output: `[0,6]`
#### Explanation:
````
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
````
## Example 2:
#### Input: `s = "abab", p = "ab"`
#### Output: `[0,1,2]`
#### Explanation:
````
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution 
````
function findAnagrams (s, p) {
    //Sliding window with a hashmap
    let windowStart = 0
    let matched = 0
    let charFreq = {}
    
    for(let i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
        const char = p[i]
        
        if(!(char in charFreq)) {
            charFreq[char] = 0
        }
        charFreq[char]++ 
    }
    
    const resultIndex = []
    
    //Our goal is to match all characters in charFreq
    //within the current window try to
    //extend the range [windowEnd, windowStart]
    for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length; windowEnd++) {
        const endChar = s[windowEnd]
        if(endChar in charFreq) {
            //decrement the frequency of match character
            charFreq[endChar]--
            if(charFreq[endChar] === 0) {
                matched++
            }      
        }
        
        if(matched === Object.keys(charFreq).length){
            //we have found an anagram
            resultIndex.push(windowStart)
        }
        
        //shrink the sliding window
        if(windowEnd >= p.length -1) {
            const startChar = s[windowStart]
            windowStart++
            if(startChar in charFreq) {
                if(charFreq[startChar] === 0) {
                    //before putting the character back
                    //decrement the matched count
                    matched--
                }
                //put the character back
                charFreq[startChar]++
            }   
        }
    }
    
    return resultIndex  
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N + M)` where `‘N’` and `‘M’` are the number of characters in the input string and the pattern respectively.
- The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(M)` since in the worst case, the whole pattern can have distinct characters which will go into the HashMap. In the worst case, we also need `O(N)` space for the result list, this will happen when the pattern has only one character and the string contains only that character.
