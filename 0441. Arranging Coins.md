# 441. Arranging Coins
https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i`th row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

 

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins1-grid.jpg)
````
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins2-grid.jpg)
````
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```` 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
## Solution 
````
function arrangeCoins(n) {
  let completeRows = 0
  let row = 1
  
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    n = n - row
    
    if(n >= 0) {
      completeRows++
    }
    row++   
  }
  
  return completeRows  
};

arrangeCoins(1)//0
arrangeCoins(5)//2, Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
arrangeCoins(8)//3, Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`.
- The space complexity is `O(1)`.
