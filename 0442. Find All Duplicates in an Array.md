# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of nums are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`
#### Output: `[2,3]`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`
#### Output: `[1]`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `nums = [1]`
#### Output: `[]`
 

## Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- Each element in `nums` appears once or twice.

## My Solution 
````
function findDuplicates(nums) {
    //This problem follows the Cyclic Sort pattern and shares similarities with Find the Duplicate Number.
    //Following a similar approach, we will place each number at its correct index. 
    //After that, we will iterate through the array to find all numbers that are not at the correct indices. All these numbers are duplicates.
    let i = 0;
    
    while(i < nums.length) {
        let j = nums[i] - 1
        
        if(nums[i] !== nums[j]) {
            //swap
            [nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[j], nums[i]]
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    
    let duplicateNumbers = []
    
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if(nums[i] !== i + 1) {
            //we have found the duplicate
            duplicateNumbers.push(nums[i])
        }
    }
    
    return duplicateNumbers
   
    //The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n).
    //Ignoring the space required for storing the duplicates, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`.
- Ignoring the space required for storing the duplicates, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
