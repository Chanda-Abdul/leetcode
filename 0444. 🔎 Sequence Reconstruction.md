# 444. ðŸ”Ž Sequence Reconstruction
https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where nums is a permutation of the integers in the range `[1, n]`. You are also given a 2D integer array `sequences` where `sequences[i]` is a subsequence of `nums`.

Check if `nums` is the shortest possible and the only <b>supersequence</b>. The shortest <b>supersequence</b> is a sequence with the <b>shortest length</b> and has all `sequences[i]` as `subsequences`. There could be multiple valid <b>supersequences</b> for the given array `sequences`.

- For example, for `sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]]`, there are two shortest <b>supersequences</b>, `[1,2,3]` and `[1,3,2]`.
- While for `sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]]`, the only shortest <b>supersequence</b> possible is `[1,2,3]`. `[1,2,3,4]` is a possible supersequence but not the shortest.

Return `true` if `nums` is the only shortest <b>supersequence</b> for `sequences`, or `false` otherwise.

A <b>supersequence</b> is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are two possible supersequences: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
Since nums is not the only shortest supersequence, we return false.
````
## Example 2:
````

Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2].
Since nums is not the shortest supersequence, we return false.
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: true
Explanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2,3].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
The sequence [2,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
Since nums is the only shortest supersequence, we return true.

## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `nums` is a permutation of all the integers in the range `[1, n]`.
- `1 <= sequences.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= sequences[i].length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= sum(sequences[i].length) <= 10^5`
- `1 <= sequences[i][j] <= n`
- All the arrays of `sequences` are unique.
- `sequences[i]` is a subsequence of `nums`.

## Solution
````js
function sequenceReconstruction(nums, sequences) {
  let reconstructed = [];
  if (nums.length < 0) return false;

  //initialize graph
  //count of incoming edges
  let steps = {};
  //adjacency list graph
  let graph = {};

  sequences.forEach((seq) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < seq.length; i++) {
      steps[seq[i]] = 0;
      graph[seq[i]] = [];
    }
  });

  //build graph
  sequences.forEach((seq) => {
    for (let i = 1; i < seq.length; i++) {
      const parent = seq[i - 1];
      const child = seq[i];
      graph[parent].push(child);
      steps[child]++;
    }
  });

  //if we dont have ordering rules for all the numbers
  //we will not be able to UNIQUELY construct the sequence
  const vertices = Object.keys(steps);

  if (vertices.length !== nums.length) return false;

  //find all sources(vertices with 0 steps)
  const sources = [];
  vertices.forEach((key) => {
    if (steps[key] === 0) sources.push(key);
  });

  //for each source, add to reconstructed and
  //decrement for all it's childrens steps
  //if a child's steps become 0, add to the source queue

  while (sources.length > 0) {
    if (sources.length > 1) {
      //more than 1 source === more than one
      //way to reconstruct the sequence
      return false;
    }

    if (nums[reconstructed.length] !== +sources[0]) {
      //the next source(or number) is different from nums
      return false;
    }

    const vertex = +sources.shift();
    reconstructed.push(vertex);
    graph[vertex].forEach((child) => {
      //get the nodes children to decrement thier steps
      steps[child]--;
      if (steps[child] === 0) sources.push(child);
    });
  }

  // if reconstructeds size !== nums size
  //there is no way to construct
  return reconstructed.length === nums.length;
}

sequenceReconstruction([1,2,3], [[1,2],[1,3]])
//false
//There are two possible supersequences: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
//The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
//The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
//Since nums is not the only shortest supersequence, we return false.
sequenceReconstruction([1,2,3], [[1,2]])
//false
//The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2].
//The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2].
//Since nums is not the shortest supersequence, we return false.
sequenceReconstruction([1,2,3],[[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]])
//true

## Complexity Analysis
- In step <b>4</b>, each task can become a source only once and each edge (a rule) will be accessed and removed once. Therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(V+E)`, where `V` is the total number of different characters and `E` is the total number of the rules in the alien language. Since, at most, each pair of words can give us one rule, therefore, we can conclude that the upper bound for the rules is `O(N)`where `N` is the number of words in the input. So, we can say that the time complexity of our algorithm is `O(V+N)`.
- The space complexity will be `O(V+N)`, since we are storing all of the rules for each character in an <i>adjacency list</i>.
