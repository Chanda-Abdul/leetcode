# 457. Circular Array Loop
https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop/

You are playing a game involving a circular array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

- If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps <b>forward</b>, and
- If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps <b>backward</b>.
Since the array is <b>circular</b>, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A <b>cycle</b> in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

- Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
- Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either <b>all positive</b> or <b>all negative</b>.
- `k > 1`
Return `true `if there is a <b>cycle</b> in `nums`, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is a cycle from index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> ...
The cycle's length is 3.
````
### Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [-1,2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because the sequence's length is 1.
By definition the sequence's length must be strictly greater than 1 to be a cycle.
````
### Example 3:
````
Input: nums = [-2,1,-1,-2,-2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because nums[1] is positive, but nums[2] is negative.
Every nums[seq[j]] must be either all positive or all negative.

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `nums[i] != 0`
 
## Follow up
- [ ] Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space complexity?

## Solution 
````
function circularArrayLoop(nums) {
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    
        //if we are moving forward or not
        let isForward = nums[i] >= 0
        let slow = i
        let fast = i

        //if slow or fast becomes -1 this means we can't find cycle for this number
        while(true) {
          // move one step for slow pointer
          slow = findNextIndex(nums, isForward, slow)
          //move one step for fast pointer
          fast = findNextIndex(nums, isForward, fast)
          if(fast !== -1){
            //move another step for the fast pointer
            fast = findNextIndex(nums, isForward, fast)
          }
          if(slow === -1 || fast === -1 || slow === fast){
            break
          }  
        }

        if(slow !== -1 && slow === fast){
          return true
        }
    } 
  return false   
};

function findNextIndex(nums, isForward, currentIndex) {
  let direction = nums[currentIndex] >= 0
  
  if(isForward !== direction){
    //change indirection, return -1
    return -1
  }
  
  nextIndex = (currentIndex + nums[currentIndex]) % nums.length
  if(nextIndex < 0) {
    //wrap around for negative numbers
    nextIndex += nums.length
  }
  
  //one element cycle, return -1
  if(nextIndex === currentIndex){
    nextIndex = -1
  }
    return nextIndex
}

## Time & Space Complexity  
- The above algorithm will have a time complexity of `O(N²)` where `‘N’` is the number of elements in the array. This complexity is due to the fact that we are iterating all elements of the array and trying to find a cycle for each element.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
## An Alternate Approach 
In our algorithm, we don’t keep a record of all the numbers that have been evaluated for cycles. We know that all such numbers will not produce a cycle for any other instance as well. If we can remember all the numbers that have been visited, our algorithm will improve to `O(N)` as, then, each number will be evaluated for cycles only once. We can keep track of this by creating a separate array, however, in this case, the space complexity of our algorithm will increase to `O(N)`.
