# 482. ðŸ”Ž License Key Formatting
https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

> Return the reformatted license key.

## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, and dashes `-`.
- `1 <= k <= 104`

## Solution
````
function licenseKeyFormatting (s, k) {
  
  let format = s.split("-").join('')
  
  let output = []
  let dash = format.length - k
  
  for(let i = format.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    output.unshift((format[i]))
    if(dash === i && i !== 0) {
      output.unshift("-")
      dash -= k
    }
  }
  
  return output.join("").toUpperCase()
};


licenseKeyFormatting ("a-a-a-a-", 1)//""
licenseKeyFormatting ("a0001afds-",4)//"A-0001-AFDS"
licenseKeyFormatting ("5F3Z-2e-9-w",4)//"5F3Z-2E9W", The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters. Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
licenseKeyFormatting ("2-5g-3-J", 2)//"2-5G-3J", The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`. The for loop and `format` runs for all elements; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be `O(N+N)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
