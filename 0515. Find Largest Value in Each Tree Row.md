# 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree (0-indexed).

## Example 1:
````
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: [1,3,9]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3]
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
````
## Example 4:
````
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [1,2]
````
## Example 5:
````
Input: root = []
Output: []
```` 
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

## My Solution
````
function largestValues (root) {
  //edge case => no root
  if(!root) return []
  
  let results = []
  let queue = [root]
  
  while(queue.length){
        const length = queue.length;
        
        let maxValue = -Infinity;
        
        for(let i=0; i<length; i++){
            let currentNode = queue.shift()
            
            maxValue = Math.max(currentNode.val, maxValue);
            
             //insert the children of the current node to the queue
            if(currentNode.left) queue.push(currentNode.left)
            if(currentNode.right) queue.push(currentNode.right)
        }
    //append the current level's max value to the result array
    results.push(maxValue);
    }
    return results
 
};
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.
