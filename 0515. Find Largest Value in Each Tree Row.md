# 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's <b>maximum depth</b> is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)
#### Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
#### Output: `3`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `root = [1,null,2]`
#### Output: `2`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `root = []`
#### Output: `0`
## Example 4:
#### Input: `root = [0]`
#### Output: `1`
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## My Solution
````
function maxDepth(root) {
    //edge case => no root
    if(!root) {
        return 0
    }
    
    let queue = [root]
    
    let maximumTreeDepth = 0
    
    while(queue.length > 0) {
        maximumTreeDepth++
        const levelSize = queue.length
        
        for(let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            let currentNode = queue.shift()
            
            //insert the children of the currentNode in the queue
            if(currentNode.left !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.left)
            }
            if(currentNode.right !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.right)
            }
        }
    }   
    return maximumTreeDepth
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.
