# 524. ðŸ”Ž Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/

> Given a string `s` and a string array `dictionary`, return the longest string in the `dictionary` that can be formed by deleting some of the given string characters. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.


## Example 1:
````js
Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
Output: "apple"
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["a","b","c"]
Output: "a"
````


## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 1000`
- `s` and `dictionary[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
## Solution 
````js
function findLongestWord(s, dictionary) {
  let longest = '';

  for (let word of dictionary) {
    let a = word.length;
    let b = longest.length;
    if (a < b || (a === b && word > longest)) continue;

    let currIndex = -1;

    for (let char of word) {
      currIndex = s.indexOf(char, currIndex + 1);
      if (currIndex === -1) break;
    }
    if (currIndex !== -1) longest = word;
  }

  return longest;
}

findLongestWord(s = 'abpcplea', dictionary = ['ale', 'apple', 'monkey', 'plea']));
// Output: "apple"

findLongestWord(s = 'abpcplea', dictionary = ['a', 'b', 'c']);
// Output: "a"

### Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(nâ‹…x)`. One iteration over all strings is required. Here nn refers to the number of strings in list `d` and `x` refers to average string length.
- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(x)`. `max_str` variable is used.
