Let's play the <b>minesweeper game</b> (Wikipedia, online game)!

You are given an `m x n` char matrix board representing the game board where:

- `'M'` represents an unrevealed mine,
- `'E'` represents an unrevealed empty square,
- `'B'` represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
- `'X'` represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array `click` where `click = [click[r], click[c]`] represents the next `click` position among all the unrevealed squares (`'M'` or `'E'`).

<i>Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:</i>

- If a mine `'M'` is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to `'X'`.
- If an empty square `'E'` with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank `'B'` and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
- If an empty square `'E'` with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
Return the `board` when no more squares will be revealed.


## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/minesweeper_example_1.png)
````js
Input: board = 
  [["E","E","E","E","E"],
  ["E","E","M","E","E"],
  ["E","E","E","E","E"],
  ["E","E","E","E","E"]], 
click = [3,0]
Output: 
  [["B","1","E","1","B"],
  ["B","1","M","1","B"],
  ["B","1","1","1","B"],
  ["B","B","B","B","B"]]
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/minesweeper_example_2.png)
````js
Input: board = 
  [["B","1","E","1","B"],
  ["B","1","M","1","B"],
  ["B","1","1","1","B"],
  ["B","B","B","B","B"]], 
click = [1,2]
Output: 
  [["B","1","E","1","B"],
  ["B","1","X","1","B"],
  ["B","1","1","1","B"],
  ["B","B","B","B","B"]]
````

## Constraints
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m`, `n <= 50`
- `board[i][j`] is either `'M'`, `'E'`, `'B'`, or a digit from `'1'` to `'8'`.
- `click.length == 2`
- `0 <= click[r] < m`
- `0 <= click[c] < n`
- `board[clickr][clickc]` is either `'M'` or `'E'`.
## Solution 



````js
function updateBoard(board, click) {
  // 'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
  // 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
  // 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
  // digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
  // 'X' represents a revealed mine.

  reveal(click[0], click[1]);

  function reveal(row, col) {
    // case 1: If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
    if (board[row][col] === 'M') {
      board[row][col] = 'X';
      return board;
    }

    // case 2: If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, 
    // then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
    else if (board[row][col] === 'E') {
      board[row][col] = 'B';

      revealNeighborsDFS(row, col);
      
    }
  }

  function revealNeighborsDFS(row, col) {
    for (let r = row - 1; r <= row + 1; r++) {
      for (let c = col - 1; c <= col + 1; c++) {
        if (r >= 0 && r < board.length && c >= 0 && c < board[0].length) {
          // case 3: If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, 
          // then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
          if (board[r][c] === 'M') {
            if (board[row][col] === 'E' || 'X') {
              board[row][col] = 1;
            } else {
              
              board[row][col]++;
            }
          }
          reveal(r, c);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
  return board;
}

updateBoard(
  (board = [
    ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
    ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
    ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
    ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
  ]),
  (click = [3, 0])
);
// Output: [
// ["B","1","E","1","B"],
// ["B","1","M","1","B"],
// ["B","1","1","1","B"],
// ["B","B","B","B","B"]]

updateBoard(
  (board = [
    ['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
    ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
    ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],
  ]),
  (click = [1, 2])
);
// Output: [
// ["B","1","E","1","B"],
// ["B","1","X","1","B"],
// ["B","1","1","1","B"],
// ["B","B","B","B","B"]]
