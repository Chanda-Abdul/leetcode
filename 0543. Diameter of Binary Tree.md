# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the <b>length</b> of the <b>diameter</b> of the tree.

The <b>diameter</b> of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The <b>length</b> of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)
````
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
````
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution 
````
function diameterOfBinaryTree (root) {
    let treeDiameter = 0
    
    calculateHeight(root)
    
    function calculateHeight(currentNode) {
        if(currentNode === null) return 0
        // console.log(currentNode)
        let leftTreeHeight = calculateHeight(currentNode.left)
        
        let rightTreeHeight = calculateHeight(currentNode.right)
        
        //diameter at the currentNode will be equal to the height of the left 
        //sub-tree the height of sub-trees + 1 for the currentNode
        const diameter = leftTreeHeight + rightTreeHeight

        //update the global tree diameter
        treeDiameter = Math.max(treeDiameter, diameter)

        //height of the currentNode will be equal to the maximum of the heights of
        //left or right sub-trees plus 1
        return Math.max(leftTreeHeight, rightTreeHeight) + 1
   
    } 
      return treeDiameter  
};

## Time & Space Complexity

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
