# 543. 👩🏽‍🦯 Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the <b>length</b> of the <b>diameter</b> of the tree.

The <b>diameter</b> of a binary tree <i>is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`</i>.

The <b>length</b> of a path between two nodes <i>is represented by the number of edges between them</i>.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)
````js
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
````
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution 
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function diameterOfBinaryTree(root) {
  let treeDiameter = 0;

  calculateHeight(root);

  function calculateHeight(currNode) {
    //base case
    if (currNode === null) return 0;

    let leftTreeHeight = calculateHeight(currNode.left);
    let rightTreeHeight = calculateHeight(currNode.right);

    //diameter at the currNode will be === to the height of
    //the left + right subTree heights
    const diameter = leftTreeHeight + rightTreeHeight;

    //update global tree diameter
    treeDiameter = Math.max(diameter, treeDiameter);

    // height of the currNode will be === to the max of the
    // heights of left or right subTrees + 1
    return Math.max(leftTreeHeight, rightTreeHeight) + 1;
  }

  return treeDiameter;
}

let root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
diameterOfBinaryTree(root);
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
diameterOfBinaryTree(root);
// Output: 1

## Complexity Analysis

- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The <b>space complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
