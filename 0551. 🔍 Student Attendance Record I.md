# 551. üîç Student Attendance Record I
https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/

You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

- `'A'`: Absent.
- `'L'`: Late.
- `'P'`: Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
- The student was absent (`'A'`) for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
- The student was never late (`'L'`) for 3 or more consecutive days.
Return `true` if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or `false` otherwise.

## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.
```` 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'L'`, or `'P'`.

## Solution 
````js
function checkRecord(s) {
  let absent = 0;
  let late = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    //The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.

    if (s[i] === 'A') absent++;
    if (absent >= 2) {
      return false;
    }
    //The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
     if (s[i] === 'L') {
      late++;
    } else {
      late = 0;
    }
    if (late >= 3) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
checkRecord('PPALLP');
//true
//The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.

checkRecord('PPALLL');
//false
//The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity is `O(N)`
- Space complexity is `O(1)`
