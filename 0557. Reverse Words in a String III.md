# 557. Reverse Words in a String III
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/

Given a string `s`, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
```` 

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` contains printable <b>ASCII</b> characters.
- `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- There is <b>at least one</b> word in `s`.
- All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

## Solution 
````
function reverseWords(s) {
  //two-pointer
  s = s.split("")
   
 let i = 0
 let begin = 0
 let stop = 1
 
 //figure out where each word stops and starts
 while(i < s.length) { 
   if(s[i] === " ") {
     stop = i-1
     reverse(begin, stop)
     i++
     begin = i
     
   }
   if(i === s.length-1) {
     stop = i
     reverse(begin, stop)
   }
   i++   
 }
  
  //reverse each word
  function reverse(start, end) {
    while(start < end) {
      [s[start], s[end]]=[s[end], s[start]]
      start++
      end--
    }
  }
  
  return  s = s.join("")  
};

reverseWords("Let's take LeetCode contest")//"s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
reverseWords("God Ding")//"doG gniD"
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N)` because we much check each item of the array/string to see if it is a white space, then go back and reverse the current word
- The space complexity of this algorithm is `O(1)`
