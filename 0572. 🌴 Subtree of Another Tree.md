# ðŸŒ´ 572. Subtree of Another Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/

Given two non-empty binary trees `s` and `t`, check whether tree `t` has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of `s`. A subtree of `s` is a tree consists of a node in `s` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `s` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

## Example 1:

Given tree `s`:
````

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
````
Given tree `t`:
````
   4 
  / \
 1   2
````
Return `true`, because `t` has the same structure and node values with a subtree of `s`.

## Example 2:

Given tree `s`:
````
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
````
Given tree `t`:
````
   4
  / \
 1   2
 ````
Return `false`.

## My Solution 

1. Build a recursive function that recursively checks whether two trees are the same
2. Use pre-order DFS, recursively checks whether `t` is a subtree of the current node
3. During DFS, if the two root nodes are the same, we use `isSubtree` to check whether they are the same tree
````
function isSubtree(s, t) {
    // whether t is a subtree of the given node
    if(!s) return !t
    return isEqual(s, t) || isSubtree(s.left, t) || isSubtree(s.right, t)
};

function isEqual(root1, root2) {
     // given a node, returns whether they are the same
    if(!root1 || !root2) return !root1 && !root2
    if(root1.val !== root2.val) return false
    return isEqual(root1.left, root2.left) && isEqual(root1.right, root2.right)
}
````

## Time Complexity
`O(N^2)` or, more precisely, `O(N*M)` where `N` is the size of tree and `M` is the size of subtree (we're iterating over a subtree for each node in the main tree)
## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursive stack.
