# 👩🏽‍🦯 🌴 572. Subtree of Another Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/

> Given two non-empty binary trees `s` and `t`, check whether tree `t` has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of `s`. 

A subtree of `s` is a tree consists of a node in `s` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `s` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree1-tree.jpg)
```js
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

## Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)
```js
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```
## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
- The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-10^4 <= root.val <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= subRoot.val <= 10^4`
## Solution 

1. Build a <i>recursive function</i> that <i>recursively</i> checks whether two trees are the same
2. Use <i>pre-order</i> <b>DFS</b>, <i>recursively</i> checks whether `t` is a subtree of the current node
3. During <b>DFS</b>, if the two root nodes are the same, we use `isSubtree` to check whether they are the same tree
```js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value, left, right) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = left || null;
    this.right = right || null;
  }
}

function isSubtree(s, t) {
  //whether t is a subtree of the given node
  if (!s) return !t;

  function isEqual(firstTree, secondTree) {
    //given a node returns if they are ===

    //base check
    if (!firstTree || !secondTree) return !firstTree && !secondTree;

    if (firstTree.val !== secondTree.val) return false;

    return isEqual(firstTree.left, secondTree.left) &&
      isEqual(firstTree.right, secondTree.right)
  }

  return isEqual(s, t) || isEqual(s.left, t) || isEqual(s.right, t);
}

let s = new TreeNode(3);
s.left = new TreeNode(4);
s.right = new TreeNode(5);
s.left.left = new TreeNode(1);
s.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
let t = new TreeNode(4);
t.left = new TreeNode(1);
t.right = new TreeNode(2);
isSubtree(s, t);
//true

s.left.right.left = new TreeNode(0);
isSubtree(s, t);
//false

```

## Time Complexity
`O(N^2)` or, more precisely, `O(N*M)` where `N` is the size of tree and `M` is the size of subtree (we're iterating over a subtree for each node in the main tree)
## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursive stack.
