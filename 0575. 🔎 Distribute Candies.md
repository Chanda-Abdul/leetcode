# 575. ðŸ”Ž Distribute Candies
https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies/#/description

Alice has `n` candies, where the ith candy is of type `candyType[i]`. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor. ðŸ¤”

The doctor advised Alice to only eat `n / 2` of the candies she has (`n` is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.

> Given the integer array `candyType` of length `n`, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats `n / 2` of them.

 
## Example 1:
````
Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3 types, she can eat one of each type.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: candyType = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types.
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: candyType = [6,6,6,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Even though she can eat 2 candies, she only has 1 type.
````

## Constraints
- `n == candyType.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^4`
- `n` is even.
- `-10^5 <= candyType[i] <= 10^5`
## Solution 
Solving this problem efficiently requires a couple of key observations.

1. If the number of unique candies is less than or equal to half the length of `candyType`, then Alice can eat one of each type of candy and the answer is equal to the number of unique candies.
2. Otherwise, the number of candies she can eat is limited to half the length of `candyType`, and so the answer is equal to half the length of `candyType`.
In essence, this problem boils down to finding the number of unique candies. We then return whichever value is smaller out of the number of unique candies and half the length of `candyType`.

In order to solve this problem, we need to identify how many unique types of candy there are. The easiest method to find unique values is with a <b>set</b>. If we convert our input array of candy `types` to a <b>set</b>, then it will only contain unique values, and thus the size of the <b>set</b> will represent the number of different candy `types`.

The only other thing to remember is that we're constrained to at most `n = candyType.length / 2` pieces, per the instructions, so we need to use a `min()` boundary before we return our answer.
```js
function distributeCandies(candyType) {
  let n = candyType.length / 2;
  let types = new Set([...candyType]);

  return Math.min(n, types.size);
}

distributeCandies(candyType = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]);
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3 types, she can eat one of each type.

distributeCandies(candyType = [1, 1, 2, 3]);
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types.

distributeCandies(candyType = [6, 6, 6, 6]);
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Even though she can eat 2 candies, she only has 1 type.
```
### Complexity Analysis

Assume, `N` is the length of `candyType`.
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(N)`. Adding an item into a <b>Set</b> has an amortized time of `O(1)`. Therefore, adding `N` items requires `O(N)` time. All of the other operations we use are `O(1)`.

- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(N)`.  The worst case for <b>space complexity</b> occurs when all `N` elements are unique. This will result in a <b>Set</b> containing `N` elements.
