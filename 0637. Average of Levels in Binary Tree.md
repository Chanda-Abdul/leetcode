# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within `10‚Åµ` of the actual answer will be accepted.
 
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/avg1-tree.jpg)
#### Input: 
`root = [3,9,20,null,15,7]`
#### Output: 
`[3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]`
#### Explanation: 
`The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].`
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/avg2-tree.jpg)
#### Input: 
`root = [3,9,20,15,7]`
#### Output: 
`[3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]`
 
## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

## My Solution
````
function averageOfLevels (root) {
    //edge case => no root
    let result = []
    
    if(!root) {
        return result
    }
    
    //initilize queue with  root
    const queue = [root]
    
    
    while(queue.length > 0){
        let levelSize = queue.length
        
        let levelSum = 0.0
         
        for(let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) { 
            let currentNode = queue.shift()
            
            //add the nodes value to the running sum
            levelSum += currentNode.val
            
            //insert the children of the current node onto the queue
            if(currentNode.left !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.left)
            }
           
            if(currentNode.right !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.right)
            }  
        }
        //append the current level's average to the result array
        result.push(levelSum/levelSize)
    }
    return result
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue
