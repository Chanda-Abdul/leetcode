# 643. Maximum Average Subarray I
#SlidingWindow #Arrays #Greedy

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/

Given an array consisting of `n` integers, find the contiguous subarray of given length `k` that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.

## Example 1:
````
Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75
````

## Note:
- `1 <= k <= n <= 30,000.`
- Elements of the given array will be in the range `[-10,000, 10,000]`.

## My Solution 
````
function findMaxAverage (nums, k) {
  let windowSum = 0
  
  
  for(let window = 0; window < k; window++) {
      //add the next element in the window
      windowSum += nums[window]
  }
  
  //set current average
  let maxAverage = windowSum/k
  
  
  for(let windowEnd = k; windowEnd < nums.length; windowEnd++) {
    //automatically slide the window, 
    //we dont need to slide if we
    //have not hit the required window size of k
    //subtract the element going out
    //and add the element coming in
    windowSum = windowSum - nums[windowEnd - k] + nums[windowEnd]
      
     //check to see if current average is more/less than previous
     //sindow average
    maxAverage = Math.max(maxAverage, windowSum/k)
  }
    
  return maxAverage
};
