# 647. üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶Ø Palindromic Substrings
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/

> Given a string `s`, return the number of <b>palindromic substrings</b> in it.

A <i>string</i> is a <b>palindrome</b> when it reads the same backward as forward.

A <b>substring</b> is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.


## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
````
 
## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
 
## Approach 3: Expand Around Possible Centers

### Intuition
This problem, like many, is all about optimization. The naive solution would be to check if each and every substring is a <i>palindrome</i>, but that would easily achieve a <i>TLE</i> result.

Instead, the first realization that we can make is that each larger <i>palindrome</i> is built upon many layers of smaller <i>palindromes</i>, going back to its <b>center</b>. So we could optimize our solution by iterating through `s` and considering the index `i` to be the `center` of a series of potential <i>palindromes</i>.

Then, for each `center` we could use two more pointers (`start` & `end`) which would spread out in both directions from `center`. As long as `s[start] == s[end]`, we'd know we had found a new <i>palindrome</i> and could continue spreading outward.

We would have to duplicate this process for even-length <i>palindromes</i>, as their center would be two characters intead of one.

‚ùï But we can optimize more than that.

If we instead think of the center of the <i>palindrome</i> not as just one or two characters, but as any length of repeated characters, then we can break each iteration down into two steps.

1. First, we identify how long the `center` is by moving our right-side pointer `end` forwards while checking for duplicate characters. Now, instead of our `center` just being a single <i>palindrome</i>, it will be the `Nth` triangular number (defined as `N * (N + 1) / 2`) to account for all the smaller <i>palindromes</i> of which it's made.
2. After that, we can spread out with `start` and `end` just as before. Since we've dealt with the entire `center`'s worth of <i>palindromes</i>, we can move `center` forward to start up again after the end of the `center`, regardless of its length.
### Algorithm
````js
function countSubstrings(s) {
  let n = s.length;
  let palindromes = 0;

  for (let center = 0; center < n; center++) {
    let start = center - 1;
    let end = center;

    while (end < n - 1 && s[end] == s[end + 1]) end++;
    palindromes += ((end - start) * (end - start + 1)) / 2;
    center = end++;
    while (start >= 0 && end < n && s[end] === s[start]) {
      start--;
      end++;
      palindromes++;
    }
  }

  return palindromes;
}

## Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time Complexity</b>: `O(N¬≤)` for input string of length `N`. The total time taken in this approach is dictated by two variables:
  - The number of possible <i>palindromic</i> `center`s we process.
  - How much time we spend processing each center.

  The number of possible <i>palindromic</i> `center`s is `2N‚àí1`: there are`N` single character `center`s and `N‚àí1` consecutive character pairs as `center`s.

  - Each `center` can potentially expand to the length of the string, so time spent on each `center` is linear on average. Thus total time spent is `N‚ãÖ(2N‚àí1)‚âÉN¬≤`.

- <b>Space Complexity</b>: `O(1)`. We don't need to allocate any extra space since we are repeatedly iterating on the input string itself.
