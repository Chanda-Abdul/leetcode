# 692. ðŸ”Ž Top K Frequent Words
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent `strings`.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the `words` with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

## Example 1:
````
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

````


## Constraints:
- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i] <= 10`.
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of unique words[i]]`

## Solution 



````js
function topKFrequent(words, k) {
  let wordMap = new Map();

  words.forEach((word) => {
    wordMap.set(word, wordMap.get(word) + 1 || 1);
  });

  let topKWords = Array.from(wordMap.entries())
    .sort((a, b) => {
      return a[1] === b[1] ? a[0]
        .localeCompare(b[0]) : b[1] - a[1];
    })
    .slice(0, k)
    .map((pair) => pair[0]);
  return topKWords;
}

topKFrequent(['i', 'love', 'leetcode', 'i', 'love', 'coding'], 2);
//["i","love"]
//"i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
//Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
topKFrequent(
  ['the', 'day', 'is', 'sunny', 'the', 'the', 'the', 'sunny', 'is', 'is'],
  4
);
//["the","is","sunny","day"]
//"the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

### Time & Space Complexity Analysis

<!-- Assume, `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(maxK*n)`, where `maxK` is the maximum value of `k` and `n` is the length of a given string `s`. We traverse a string of size `n` and iterate `k` times to decode each pattern of form `k[string]`. This gives us worst case time complexity as `O(maxK*n)`.

- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(m+n)`, where `m` is the number of letters(`a-z`) and `n` is the number of digits(`0-9`) in string `s`. In worst case, the maximum size of `stringStack` and `countStack` could be `m` and `n` respectively. -->
## Follow-up: 
- [ ] Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?
