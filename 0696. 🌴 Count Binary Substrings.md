# 696. ðŸŒ´ Count Binary Substrings
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/

> Give a binary string `s`, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of `0`'s and `1`'s, and all the `0`'s and all the `1`'s in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

<b>Substrings</b> that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.


## Example 1:
```js
Input: s = "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: 
"0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
```
## Example 2:
```js
Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are 4 substrings: 
"10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution 
Since the `0`'s and `1`'s have to be grouped consecutively, we only have to be concerned with the most recent two groups (`curr`, `prev`) at any time as we iterate through the input string `s`. Since each addition to our answer `subStrings` must therefore be centered on the <i>"edge"</i> between the two groups, we should be able to count multiple increases to ans at the same time.

For example, if we find a group that is `"0001111"`, then we know that we've found multiple answer counts centered on the `"01"`. Each additional extra character on both sides will be an extra answer, which means that `"0011"` and `"000111"` are also `subStrings`. In other words, the number that we should add to ans is equal to `Math.min(zeros, ones)`, or `3` in this example.

So we can now iterate through `s`, keeping track of the `curr` and `prev` groups, and when we find the end of a group, we can calculate our addition to `subStrings` and then swap the two variables while resetting `curr` to `1`.

Since we're going to be comparing `s[i]` to `s[i-1]` to see if the character has changed, we'll need to start our iteration with `i = 1` which means we should define a starting value for `curr` of `1`. Also, since the end of `s` is technically the end of a group, we should add another `Math.min(curr, prev)` onto ans before we return `subStrings`, as it won't be accounted for in the iteration through `s`.

```js
function countBinarySubstrings(s) {
  let prev = 0;
  let curr = 1;
  let subStrings = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) curr++;
    else {
      subStrings += Math.min(curr, prev);
      prev = curr;
      curr = 1;
    }
  }

  return subStrings + Math.min(curr, prev);
}

countBinarySubstrings((s = '00110011'));
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
  // There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: 
  // "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
// Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
// Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

countBinarySubstrings((s = '10101'));
// Output: 4
// Explanation: 
  // There are 4 substrings: 
  // "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
```

## Complexity Analysis
- <b>Time Complexity</b>: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `s`. Every loop is through `O(N)` items with `O(1)` work inside the `for`-block.
- <b>Space Complexity</b>: `O(1)`, the space used by the space used by `prev`, `curr`, and `subStrings`.
