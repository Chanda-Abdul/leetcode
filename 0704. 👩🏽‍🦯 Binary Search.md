# 704. 👩🏽‍🦯 Binary Search
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

> Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Example 1:
````js
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```` 

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution
````js
function search(nums, target) {
  //Binary Search
  let start = 0;
  let end = nums.length - 1;

  while (start <= end) {
    //calculate the middle of the current range
    let mid = Math.floor(start + (end - start) / 2);

    if (target === nums[mid]) {
      return mid;
    } else if (target < nums[mid]) {
      //the target can be in the fist half
      end = mid - 1;
    } else {
      //target > nums[mid], so the key can be in the second half
      start = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  //target not found
  return -1;
}

search([-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], 9);
//4
//9 exists in nums and its index is 4

search([-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], 2);
//-1
//2 does not exist in nums so return -1
````

## Complexity Analysis
- Since, we are reducing the search range by half at every step, this means that the time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(logN)` where `N` is the total elements in the given array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
