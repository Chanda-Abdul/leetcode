# 740. Delete and Earn
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and every element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return the <b>maximum number</b> of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

 

## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
 ````

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
## Solution
````
function deleteAndEarn(nums) {
  //Bottom-up approach
  let maxPoints = -Infinity;

  let numsMap = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    maxPoints = Math.max(nums[i], maxPoints);
  }

  let arr = Array(maxPoints + 1).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    arr[nums[i]]++;
  }

  let dp = Array(arr.length).fill(-1);

  dp[arr.length] = 0;
  dp[arr.length + 1] = 0;

  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i + 1], arr[i] * i + dp[i + 2]);
  }

  return dp[0];
}
