# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/

Given a characters array `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character `target`, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than `target`.

<b>Note</b> that the letters wrap around.

For example, if `target == 'z'` and `letters == ['a', 'b']`, the answer is `a`.
 

## Example 1:
````
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
Output: "f"
````

## Constraints:
- `2 <= letters.length <= 104`
- `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.
- `target` is a lowercase English letter.

## Solution
````
function nextGreatestLetter(letters, target) {
    let n = letters.length
    let start = 0
    let end = n -1
    
    while(start <= end) {
        let mid = Math.floor(start + (end-start)/2)
        
        if(target < letters[mid]) {
            end = mid -1
            
        } else {
            //target > letters[mid]
            start = mid + 1
        }
    }
 
    return letters[start % n] 
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- Since, we are reducing the search range by half at every step, this means that the time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(log N)` where `N` is the total elements in the given array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
