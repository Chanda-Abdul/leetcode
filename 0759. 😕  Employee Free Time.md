# 759. ðŸ˜• Employee Free Time
https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/

We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing <b>common, positive-length free time</b> for all employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like `[5, 5]` in our answer, as they have zero length.

## Example 1:
````
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
````
## Constraints:
- `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
- `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`

## Solution 
````
function employeeFreeTime (schedule) {
    let freeTime = []
    
    //combine all schedules
    let allTime = []
    
    for(let i = 0; i < schedule.length; i++) {
        for(let j = 0; j < schedule[i].length; j++) {
            allTime.push(schedule[i][j])
        }
    }
    
    allTime.sort((a, b) => a.start-b.start)
    
    //merge the overlap
    for(let i = 1; i <  allTime.length; i++){
        let current =  [allTime[i].start, allTime[i].end]
        let previous =  [allTime[i-1].start, allTime[i-1].end]
        console.log(previous, current)
        if(current[0] < previous[1]) {
            allTime[i] = [previous[0], current[1]]
            allTime.splice(i-1, 1)
            i--
        }
    } 
    
    //whatever is not accounted for is free time
    for(let i = 1; i < allTime.length; i++) {
        let start = allTime[i-1][1]
        let end = allTime[i][0]
        freeTime.push(new Interval(start, end))
    }
    
    return freeTime
    
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- This algorithm will take `O(N * logN)` time, where `â€˜Nâ€™` is the total number of intervals. This time is needed because we need to sort all the intervals. 
- The space complexity will be `O(N)`, which is needed for sorting.
