# 766. üòêüìñ Toeplitz Matrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/

Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return `true` if the `matrix` is <b>Toeplitz</b>. Otherwise, return `false`.

A `matrix` is <b>Toeplitz</b> if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

 

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex1.jpg)
````
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex2.jpg)
````
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```` 

## Constraints:
- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 20`
- `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 99`
## Solution 
````js
function isToeplitzMatrix(matrix) {
  
  for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length - 1; j++) {
      console.log(matrix[i+1][j+1], matrix[i][j])
      if (matrix[i+1][j+1] !== matrix[i][j]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}

isToeplitzMatrix([[1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 1, 2, 3],[9, 5, 1, 2],]);
// In the above grid, the diagonals are:
// "[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
// In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.

isToeplitzMatrix([[1, 2],[2, 2],]);
// The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.

## Follow up:

- [ ] What if the `matrix` is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the `matrix` into the memory at once?
- [ ] What if the `matrix` is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?
