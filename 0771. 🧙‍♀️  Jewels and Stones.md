# üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 771. Jewels and Stones 
https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of `stones` that are `jewels`, and `stones` representing the `stones` you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the `stones` you have are also `jewels`.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"`
#### Output: `3`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"`
#### Output: `0`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
- `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
- All the characters of `jewels` are <b>unique</b>.

## Solution
````
function numJewelsInStones (jewels, stones) {
    let jewelSet = new Set(jewels.split("")) 
    let stonesAndJewels = 0
    
    for(let i = 0; i < stones.length; i++) { 
      if(jewelSet.has(stones.charAt(i))){
        stonesAndJewels++
      }
    }
    
    return stonesAndJewels 
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The abouve algorithm has a Time-complexity of `O(n)`
    - `jewelSet => O(n)`
- The abouve algorithm has Space-complexity of `O(n)`
    - `jewelSet => O(n)`
    - `stonesAndJewels => O(1)`
