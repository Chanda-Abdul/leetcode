# 784. Letter Case Permutation
https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-case-permutation/

Given a string `s`, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

Return a list of all possible strings we could create. Return the output in any order.

## Example 1:
### Input
`s = "a1b2"`
### Output
`["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]`
## Example 2:
### Input
`s = "3z4"`
### Output
`["3z4","3Z4"]`
 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 12`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, uppercase English letters, and digits.
## Solution 
````
function letterCasePermutation(s) {
    const permutations = []
    permutations.push(s)
    
    //process every character of the string one by one
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        //only characters we will skip digits
        if(isNaN(parseInt(s[i]), 10)) {
            //we will take all exixting permutations and change the letter case appropriately
            const n = permutations.length
            
            for(let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                //string to array
                const chs = permutations[j].split('')
                
                //if the current character is in upper case
                //change it to lower case or vice verse
                if(chs[i] === chs[i].toLowerCase()) {
                    chs[i] = chs[i].toUpperCase()
                } else {
                    chs[i] = chs[i].toLowerCase()
                }
                permutations.push(chs.join(''))
            }
        }
    }
    
    return permutations 
};

## Time & Space Complexity 
- Since we can have `2ᴺ` permutations at the most and while processing each permutation we convert it into a character array, the overall time complexity of the algorithm will be `O(N*2ᴺ)`.
- All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we can have a total of `O(2ᴺ)` permutations, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(N*2ᴺ)`.
