# 818. ðŸ”Ž Race Car
https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/
> Given an array of unique strings `words`, return all the word squares you can build from `words`. The same word from `word`s can be used multiple times. You can return the answer in any order.

A sequence of strings forms a valid word square if the `kth` row and column read the same string, where `0 <= k < max(numRows, numColumns)`.

For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.
 

## Example 1:
````js
Input: words = ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output: [["ball","area","lead","lady"],["wall","area","lead","lady"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. 
The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: words = ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
Output: [["baba","abat","baba","atal"],["baba","abat","baba","atan"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. 
The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

## Constraints
- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 4`
- All `words[i]` have the same length.
- `words[i`] consists of only lowercase English letters.
- All `words[i]` are <b>unique</b>.

## Solution 
````js
function racecar(target) {
 let options = [{moves: 0, position: 0, speed: 1}]
 let best = Infinity
 
 while(options.length){
   let {moves, position, speed} = options.pop()
   
   if(position === target){
     best = Math.min(best, moves)
   }
   
   if(moves >= best) continue
   
   //Attempt to move forward
   options.push({moves: moves+1, position: position+speed, speed: speed*2})
   
   if((position +speed > target && speed > 0) || (position +speed < target && speed < 0)){
     //Reverse if we are moving in the wrong direction
    options.push({moves: moves+1, position, speed: speed > 0 ? -1 : 1})
   }
 }
  
  return best
}

racecar(3)
// Output: 2
// The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
// Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.

racecar(6);
// Output: 5
// The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
// Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
