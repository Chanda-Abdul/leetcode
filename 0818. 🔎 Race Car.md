# 818. ðŸ”Ž Race Car
https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/

Your car starts at `position` `0` and `speed` `+1` on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions `'A'` (accelerate) and `'R'` (reverse):
- When you get an instruction `'A'`, your car does the following:
  - `position += speed`
  - `speed *= 2`
- When you get an instruction `'R'`, your car does the following:
  - If your `speed` is positive then `speed = -1`
  - otherwise `speed = 1`
  - Your position stays the same.
 
For example, after commands `"AAR"`, your car goes to `position`s `0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3`, and your `speed` goes to `1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1`.

> Given a target position `target`, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

## Example 1:
````js
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
````


## Constraints
- `1 <= target <= 10^4`

## Solution 
````js
function racecar(target) {
 let options = [{moves: 0, position: 0, speed: 1}]
 let best = Infinity
 
 while(options.length){
   let {moves, position, speed} = options.pop()
   
   if(position === target){
     best = Math.min(best, moves)
   }
   
   if(moves >= best) continue
   
   //Attempt to move forward
   options.push({moves: moves+1, position: position+speed, speed: speed*2})
   
   if((position +speed > target && speed > 0) || (position +speed < target && speed < 0)){
     //Reverse if we are moving in the wrong direction
    options.push({moves: moves+1, position, speed: speed > 0 ? -1 : 1})
   }
 }
  
  return best
}

racecar(3)
// Output: 2
// The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
// Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.

racecar(6);
// Output: 5
// The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
// Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
