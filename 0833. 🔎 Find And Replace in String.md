# 833. ðŸ”Ž Find And Replace in String 
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-in-string/

You are given a <b>0-indexed</b> string `s` that you must perform `k` replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three <b>0-indexed</b> parallel arrays, `indices`, `sources`, and `targets`, all of length `k`.

To complete the `ith` replacement operation:
1. Check if the <b>substring</b> `sources[i]` occurs at index `indices[i]` in the <b>original string</b> `s`.
2. If it does not occur, <b>do nothing</b>.
3. Otherwise if it does occur, <b>replace</b> that substring with `targets[i]`.

For example, if `s = "abcd"`, `indices[i] = 0`, `sources[i] = "ab"`, and `targets[i] = "eee"`, then the result of this replacement will be `"eeecd"`.

All replacement operations must occur <b>simultaneously</b>, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will <b>not overlap</b>.
- For example, a testcase with `s = "abc"`, `indices = [0, 1]`, and `sources = ["ab","bc"]` will not be generated because the `"ab"` and `"bc"` replacements overlap.
- 
Return the <b>resulting string</b> after performing all replacement operations on `s`.

A <b>substring</b> is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/833-ex1.png)
````
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
Explanation:
"a" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"cd" occurs at index 2 in s, so we replace it with "ffff".
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/833-ex2-1.png)
````
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeecd"
Explanation:
"ab" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"ec" does not occur at index 2 in s, so we do nothing.
 ````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `k == indices.length == sources.length == targets.length`
- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `0 <= indexes[i] < s.length`
- `1 <= sources[i].length, targets[i].length <= 50`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `sources[i]` and `targets[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution 
````
function findReplaceString(s, indices, sources, targets) {
  s = s.split('');

  indices.forEach((idxinidx, i) => {
    const [idx, src, tgt] = [indices[i], sources[i], targets[i]];
    
    if(s.slice(idx, idx+src.length).join("") === src){
      s[idxinidx] = [tgt]
      let replacements = src.length -1
      
      while(replacements > 0){
        idxinidx++
        s[idxinidx] = ''
        replacements--
      }
    } 
  })
    
  return s.join('');
}

findReplaceString('vmokgggqzp',[3, 5, 1],['kg', 'ggq', 'mo'], ['s', 'so', 'bfr']);
//"vbfrssozp"

findReplaceString('abcd', [0, 2], ['a', 'cd'], ['eee', 'ffff']);
//"eeebffff",
//"a" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
//"cd" occurs at index 2 in s, so we replace it with "ffff".
findReplaceString('abcd', [0, 2], ['ab', 'ec'], ['eee', 'ffff']);
//"eeecd"
//"ab" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
//"ec" does not occur at index 2 in s, so we do nothing.
