# 876. Middle of the Linked List


https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node `head`, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the <b>second middle</b> node.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)
````
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)
````
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
````

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.value <= 100`

## Solution
````
class Node {
  constructor(value, next = null) {
    this.value = value
    this.next = next
  }
}


function middleNode (head) {
  //We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method such that the 
  //fast pointer is always twice the nodes ahead of the slow pointer. 
  //This way, when the fast pointer reaches the end of the LinkedList, 
  //the slow pointer will be pointing at the middle node.
  
  let fast = head
  let slow = head
  
  while(fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
  }
  
  return slow   
};

head = new Node(1)
head.next = new Node(2)
head.next.next = new Node(3)
head.next.next.next = new Node(4)
head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5)

console.log(`Middle Node: ${middleNode(head).value}`)

head.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(6)
console.log(`Middle Node: ${middleNode(head).value}`)

head.next.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(7)
console.log(`Middle Node: ${middleNode(head).value}`)
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm will have a time complexity of `O(N)` where `‘N’` is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
