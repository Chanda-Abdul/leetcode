# 876. Middle of the Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/

> Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.
> 
> If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Example 1:

#### Input: `[1,2,3,4,5]`
#### Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: `[3,4,5]`)
The returned node has value `3`.  (The judge's serialization of this node is `[3,4,5]`).

Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
`ans.val = 3`, `ans.next.val = 4`, `ans.next.next.val = 5`, and `ans.next.next.next = NULL`.
## Example 2:

#### Input: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
#### Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: `[4,5,6]`)
Since the list has two middle nodes with values `3 and 4`, we return the second one.
 

## Note:

The number of nodes in the given list will be between `1` and `100`.

## My Solution
````
function middleNode(head) {
    //We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method such that the 
    //fast pointer is always twice the nodes ahead of the slow pointer. 
    //This way, when the fast pointer reaches the end of the LinkedList, 
    //the slow pointer will be pointing at the middle node.
    let fast = head
    let slow = head
    
    while(fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    }
    return slow  
};
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm will have a time complexity of `O(N)` where `‘N’` is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
