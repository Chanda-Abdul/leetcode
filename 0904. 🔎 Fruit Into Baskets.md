# 904. ðŸ”Ž Fruit Into Baskets

https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
- You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

> Given the integer array `fruits`, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.



## Example 1:
````
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```` 

## Note:

- `1 <= tree.length <= 40000`
- `0 <= tree[i] < tree.length`

## Map Class Solution

  let windowStart = 0
  let windowMax = 0
  let fruitMap = new Map()

  
  //1. try to extend the window range
  for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < fruits.length; windowEnd++) {
    let endFruit = fruits[windowEnd]
    
    fruitMap.set(endFruit, fruitMap.get(endFruit)+1 || 1)
    
    //2. Shrink the sliding window, until we are left with 2 fruits in the fruitMap
    while(fruitMap.size > 2) {
      let startFruit = fruits[windowStart]
      
      fruitMap.set(startFruit, fruitMap.get(startFruit)-1)
      
      if(fruitMap.get(startFruit) === 0){
        fruitMap.delete(startFruit)
      }
      windowStart++

    windowMax = Math.max(windowMax, windowEnd - windowStart + 1)

totalFruit ([3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4])//5
totalFruit ([1,2,1])//3,We can pick from all 3 trees.
totalFruit ([0,1,2,2])//3,We can pick from trees [1,2,2].If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

## Time and Space Complexity

- The above algorithmâ€™s time complexity will be `O(N)`, where `â€˜Nâ€™` is the number of characters in the input array. The outer for loop runs for all characters, and the inner while loop processes each character only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be `O(N+N)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N)`.

- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)` as there can be a maximum of three types of fruits stored in the frequency map.
