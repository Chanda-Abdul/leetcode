# 0929. ðŸ”Ž Unique Email Addresses
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/

Every valid email consists of a `local name` and a `domain name`, separated by the `@` sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more `.` or `+`.

For example, in `alice@leetcode.com`, `alice` is the local name, and `leetcode.com` is the domain name.

If you add periods `.` between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.

For example,`"alice.z@leetcode.com` and `alicez@leetcode.com` forward to the same email address.
If you add a plus `+` in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.

For example, `m.y+name@email.com` will be forwarded to `my@email.com`.
It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given an array of strings emails where we send one email to each `emails[i]`, return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.

## Example 1:
````
Input: emails = ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: emails = ["a@leetcode.com","b@leetcode.com","c@leetcode.com"]
Output: 3
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= emails.length <= 100`
- `1 <= emails[i].length <= 100`
- `emails[i]` consist of lowercase English letters, `+`, `.` and `@`.
- Each `emails[i]` contains exactly one `@` character.
- All local and domain names are non-empty.
- Local names do not start with a `+` character.
- Domain names end with the `.com` suffix.


## String Split Method Solution

````
function numUniqueEmails (emails) {
  // hash set to store all the unique emails
    let uniqueEmails = new Set();

    emails.forEach((email) => {
        
      // split into two parts local and domain
      let parts = email.split("@");
      
      // split local by '+'
      let local = parts[0].split("+");
      
      // remove all '.', and concatenate '@' and append domain
      uniqueEmails.add(local[0].replaceAll(".", "") + "@" + parts[1]);
    });

    return uniqueEmails.size;
};


numUniqueEmails (["fg.r.u.uzj+o.pw@kziczvh.com",
        "r.cyo.g+d.h+b.ja@tgsg.z.com","fg.r.u.uzj+o.f.d@kziczvh.com","r.cyo.g+ng.r.iq@tgsg.z.com","fg.r.u.uzj+lp.k@kziczvh.com","r.cyo.g+n.h.e+n.g@tgsg.z.com","fg.r.u.uzj+k+p.j@kziczvh.com","fg.r.u.uzj+w.y+b@kziczvh.com","r.cyo.g+x+d.c+f.t@tgsg.z.com","r.cyo.g+x+t.y.l.i@tgsg.z.com","r.cyo.g+brxxi@tgsg.z.com","r.cyo.g+z+dr.k.u@tgsg.z.com","r.cyo.g+d+l.c.n+g@tgsg.z.com","fg.r.u.uzj+vq.o@kziczvh.com","fg.r.u.uzj+uzq@kziczvh.com","fg.r.u.uzj+mvz@kziczvh.com","fg.r.u.uzj+taj@kziczvh.com","fg.r.u.uzj+fek@kziczvh.com"])

numUniqueEmails (["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"])//2,"testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails.

### Time & Space Complexity

Let `N` be the number of the emails and `M` be the average length of an email.
- The Time Complexity is `O(N*M)`, The split method must iterate over all of the characters in each email and the replace method must iterate over all of the characters in each local name. As such, they both require linear time and are `O(M)` operations. Since there are `N` emails and the average email has `M` characters in it, the complexity is of order `(Number of emails) * (Number of characters in an email) = N*M`.
- The Space Complexity is `O(N*M)`, In the worst case, when all emails are unique, we will store every email address given to us in the hash set.

## Linear Iteration Solution
````
let numUniqueEmails = function (emails) {
    // hash set to store all the unique emails
    let uniqueEmails = new Set();

    emails.forEach((email) => {
        let cleanMail = [];

        // iterate over each character in email
        for (let i = 0; i < email.length; ++i) {
            let currChar = email.charAt(i);

            // stop adding characters to localName
            if (currChar === "+" || currChar === "@") break;

            // add this character if not '.'
            if (currChar !== ".") cleanMail.push(currChar);
        }

        // compute domain name (substring from end to '@')
        let domainName = [];

        for (i = email.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            let currChar = email.charAt(i);
            domainName.push(currChar);
            if (currChar == "@") break;
        }

        domainName = domainName.reverse().join("");
        cleanMail = cleanMail.join("");

        uniqueEmails.add(cleanMail + domainName);
    });

    return uniqueEmails.size;
};

### Time & Space Complexity
Let `N` be the number of the emails and `M` be the average length of an email.
- The Time Complexity is `O(N*M)`, In the worst case, we iterate over all the characters of each of the emails given.  If we have `N` emails and each email has `M` characters in it. Then complexity is of order `(Number of emails) * (Number of characters in average email) = N*M`.
- The Space Complexity is `O(N*M)`, In the worst case, when all emails are unique, we will store every email address given to us in the hash set.
