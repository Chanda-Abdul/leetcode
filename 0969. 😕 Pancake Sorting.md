# üòï 969. Pancake Sorting 
https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting/

Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of <b>pancake flips</b>.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:
- Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
- Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (<b>0-indexed</b>).

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [1,2,3,4]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return an array of the `k`-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

 
## Example 1:
````js
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
````
## Example 2:
````js
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length`
- All integers in `arr` are <b>unique</b> (i.e. arr is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `arr.length`).

## Solution
````js

function pancakeSort(arr) {
  let flippedArr = [...arr]
  for (let i = flippedArr.length-1; i > 0; i--) {
    let maxIndex = findMaxIndexInPrefix(flippedArr, i);
    flip(flippedArr, maxIndex);
    flip(flippedArr, i);
  }
  console.log(arr,flippedArr)

  return flippedArr;

  function findMaxIndexInPrefix(flippedArr, k) {
    let currMax = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
      if (flippedArr[i] > flippedArr[currMax]) currMax = i;
    }
    return currMax;
  }
  
  
  function flip(flippedArr, k) {
    //sort
    let pivot = Math.floor((k+1)/2)
    for(let i = 0; i < pivot; i++){
      [flippedArr[i], flippedArr[k-i]] = [flippedArr[k-i], flippedArr[i]]
    }
  }
}

console.log(pancakeSort((arr = [3, 2, 4, 1])));
// Output: [4,2,4,3]
// Explanation:
// We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
// Starting state: flippedArr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
// After 1st flip (k = 4): flippedArr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
// After 2nd flip (k = 2): flippedArr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
// After 3rd flip (k = 4): flippedArr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
// After 4th flip (k = 3): flippedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.

console.log(pancakeSort((arr = [1, 2, 3])));
// Output: []
// Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
// Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
