# 986. ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒ´ Interval List Intersections
https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [startáµ¢, endáµ¢]` and `secondList[j] = [startâ±¼, endâ±¼]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise <b>disjoint</b> and in <b>sorted order</b>.

Return the <i>intersection of these two interval lists</i>.

A <b>closed interval</b> `[a, b]` (with `a < b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.
## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png)
````
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: firstList = [], secondList = [[4,8],[10,12]]
Output: []
````
## Example 4:
````
Input: firstList = [[1,7]], secondList = [[3,10]]
Output: [[3,7]]
````
## Constraints:
- `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
- `firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 109`
- `endi < starti+1`
- `0 <= startj < endj <= 109`
- `endj < startj+1`
## Solution 
````
function intervalIntersection (firstList, secondList) {
    let result = []
    let i = 0
    let j = 0
    
    while(i < firstList.length && j < secondList.length) {
        //check if the intervals overlap and if firstList[i]'s
        //starttime lies within secondList[j]
        let firstOverlapsSecond = firstList[i][0] >= secondList[j][0] && firstList[i][0] <= secondList[j][1]
        
        //check if the intervals overlap and firstList interval[j]'s start time
        //lies within the other secondList[i]
        let SecondOverlapsFirst = secondList[j][0] >= firstList[i][0] && secondList[j][0] <= firstList[i][1]
        
        //store the intersection part
        if(firstOverlapsSecond || SecondOverlapsFirst) {
            result.push([Math.max(firstList[i][0],secondList[j][0]),Math.min(firstList[i][1],secondList[j][1])])
        }
        
        //next move onto the interval that is finishing first
        if(firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]) {
            i++
        } else {
            j++
        }
    }
    return result  
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- As we are iterating through both the lists once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N + M)`, where `â€˜Nâ€™` and `â€˜Mâ€™` are the total number of intervals in the input arrays respectively.
- Ignoring the space needed for the result list, the algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
