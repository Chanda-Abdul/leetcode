# 1002. Find Common Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/

Given an array `A` of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list <b>(including duplicates)</b>.  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

 

#### Example 1:
Input: `["bella","label","roller"]`

Output: `["e","l","l"]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `["cool","lock","cook"]`

Output: `["c","o"]`
 

## Note:

- `1 <= A.length <= 100`
- `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
- `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter

## My Solution

````
const commonChars = function(A) {
  let similar = []
  let firstWord = [...A[0]]
  for(const letter of firstWord) {
    if(A.every(word => word.includes(letter))) {
      similar.push(letter)
      A = A.map(word => word.replace(letter, ''))
    } 
  }

return similar    
};

````
