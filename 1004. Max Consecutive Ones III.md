# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
#SlidingWindow

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.

## Example 1:

#### Input: `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2`
#### Output: `6`
#### Explanation: 
`[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]`
Bolded numbers were flipped from `0` to `1`. The longest subarray is underlined.
## Example 2:

#### Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3`
#### Output: `10`
#### Explanation: 
`[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`
Bolded numbers were flipped from `0` to `1`. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i] is either 0 or 1.`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`

## My Solution 
````
function longestOnes(nums, k) {
    let windowStart = 0
    let maxLength = 0
    let maxOnesCount = 0
    
     //Try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
    for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < nums.length; windowEnd++) {
        if(nums[windowEnd] === 1) {
            maxOnesCount++
        }
        //current window size is from windowStart to windowEnd, overall we have a 
        //maximum of 1s repeating maxOnesCount times, this means we can have a window 
        //with maxOnesCount 1s and the remaining are 0s which should replace with 1s
        //now, if the remaining 0s are more that k, it is the time to shrink the 
        //window as we are not allowed to replace more than k 0s
        if((windowEnd - windowStart + 1 - maxOnesCount) > k) {
            if(nums[windowStart] === 1) {
                maxOnesCount--
            }
            windowStart++
        }
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1)
    }
    return maxLength  
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- The above algorithm’s time complexity will be `O(N)`, where `‘N’` is the count of numbers in the input array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
