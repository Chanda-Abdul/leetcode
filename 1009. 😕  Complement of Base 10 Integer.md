# 1009. ðŸ˜• Complement of Base 10 Integer
https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

Every non-negative integer `num` has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for n = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.

For a given number n in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `n = 5`
#### Output: `2`
#### Explanation: `5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.`
## Example 2:
#### Input: `n = 7`
#### Output: `0`
#### Explanation: `7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.`
## Example 3:
#### Input: `n = 10`
#### Output: `5`
#### Explanation: `10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.`

## Note:
- `0 <= n < 109`

## Solution 
````
function bitwiseComplement(num) {
    if(num === 0) return 1
    //count number of total bits in n
    let bitCount = 0
    let n = num
    while(n > 0) {
        bitCount++
        n = n >> 1
        //The right shift operator ( >> ) shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right. 
        //Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded.
    }
    
    //for a number which is a complete power of two, i.e., it can be wrtiten as pow(1, n),
    //if we subtract 1 from such a number, we get a number which has n least significant bits set to 1
    //For example, 4 which is a complete power of 2, and 3 (which is one less than 4) ahs a binary
    //representation of 11 i.e., it has 2 least significant bits set to 1
    let allBitsSet = Math.pow(2, bitCount) - 1
    
    //complement = number ^ allBitsSet
    return num ^ allBitsSet
    
};

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity of this solution is `O(b`)where `b` is the number of bits required to store the given number.
- Space complexity of this solution is `O(1)`.
