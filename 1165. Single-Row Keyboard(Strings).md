# 1165. Single-Row Keyboard(Strings)
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-row-keyboard/

#

There is a special keyboard with <b>all keys in a single row</b>.

Given a string `keyboard` of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index `i` to index `j` is `|i - j|`.

You want to type a string `word`. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.
 #
#### Example 1:

<b>Input:</b> `keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`, `word = "cba"`

<b>Output:</b> `4`

<b>Explanation:</b> The index moves from `0` to `2` to write `'c'` then to `1` to write `'b'` then to `0` again to write `'a'`.

Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. 

#### Example 2:

<b>Input:</b> `keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno"`, `word = "leetcode"`

<b>Output:</b> `73`

## Constraints
- `keyboard.length == 26`
- `keyboard` contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
- `1 <= word.length <= 10^4`
- `word[i]` is an English lowercase letter.

## My Solution
```
const calculateTime = function(keyboard, word) {
  //variable to store movements
  let movements = 0;
  
  //find index of first letter
  let current = 0;
  
  //create a hashmap that stores the index of each letter 
  const myMap = new Map();
  for(let i = 0; i<keyboard.length; i++){
    myMap.set(keyboard.charAt(i), i)
  }
  
  //add the postive difference to the movements variable 
  //as you go to each consecutive letter in word
  for(const w of word) {
    const indx = myMap.get(w);
    movements += Math.abs(indx - current)
    current = indx;
  }
  
  //return the movements variable
  return movements;   
};

calculateTime("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "cba")
calculateTime("pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", "leetcode")
```

## Time Complexity

Linear time of `O(n)`
