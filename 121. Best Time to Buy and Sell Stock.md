## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

## Example 1:

##### Input: `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`
##### Output: `5`
##### Explanation: 
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
## Example 2:

##### Input: `[7,6,4,3,1]`
##### Output: `0`
##### Explanation: 
In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
## My Solution 

```
const maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let buy = prices[0]
  let maxProfit = 0
  
  //start a for loop at the first day available to sell stock, index 1
  for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
  
    //if the sell price on that day minus the buy price is greater than the current max profit, then set that to current max profit
    if(prices[i] - buy > maxProfit) {
      maxProfit = prices[i] - buy
    }
    
    //OR if the sell price is less than the previous buy price, then set that lower price to the buy price
    if(prices[i] < buy) {
      buy = prices[i]
    }
  }
  
  //return the max profit
  return maxProfit
}
```

## Input
```
maxProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])
maxProfit([7,6,4,3,1])
```
## Output
```
5
0
```
## Time Complexity

Linear time of `O(n)`
