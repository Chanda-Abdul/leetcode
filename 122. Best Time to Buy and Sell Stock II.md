## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

Say you have an array ```prices``` for which the `ith` element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

<b>Note:</b> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
#

### Example 1:

<b>Input: </b> `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`

<b>Output:</b> `7`

<b>Explanation:</b> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

### Example 2:

<b>Input: </b>`[1,2,3,4,5]`

<b>Output:</b>`4`

<b>Explanation:</b>  Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
### Example 3:

<b>Input: </b> `[7,6,4,3,1]`

<b>Output:</b>`0`

<b>Explanation:</b>In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
#
### Constraints:

```1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4```

```0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4```
#
### My Soultion:
````
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
   let profit = 0
  
  for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    let buy = prices[i -1]
    let sell = prices[i]
    if(buy < sell) {
      profit += sell - buy
    }
  }
  return profit
};

maxProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])
maxProfit([1,2,3,4,5])
maxProfit([7,6,4,3,1])
````
