Say you have an array ```prices``` for which the `ith` element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

<b>Note:</b> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
#

<b>Example 1:</b>
```
<b>Input: </b>[7,1,5,3,6,4]
<b>Output:</b> 7
<b>Explanation:</b> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
 ```
<b>Example 2:</b>

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
<b>Example 3:</b>

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
 

<b>Constraints:</b>

```1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4```
```0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4```
