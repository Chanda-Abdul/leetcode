# ðŸ˜• 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/

We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

## Example 1:
````
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
 ````
## Constraints:

- `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= profit[i] <= 104`

## My Solution (IN PROGRESS)
````
function jobScheduling (startTime, endTime, profit) {

  let n = startTime.length
  let jobs = []
  let maxProfit = 0
  
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    jobs.push([startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i]])
    // maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit[i])
  }
  
  //sort jobs
  jobs.sort((a,b) => a[0]-b[0])
  
  let dp = profit;
// dp[0] = jobs[0][2];
  
  console.log(dp)
  
  for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    maxProfit = jobs[i][2]
    let task = -1
    
    for(let j = i-1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if(jobs[j][1] <= jobs[i][0]) {
        task = j
        break
      }
    }
    if(task != -1) {
      maxProfit += dp[task]
      dp[i] = Math.max(maxProfit, dp[i-1])
    }
  }
  return dp[n-1]
  //add any jobs that dont have overlap to the profit and remove from jobs array
  for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    let current = jobs[i]
    let previous = jobs[i-1]
    let next = jobs[i+1]
    
    //job at begining of array doesn't have overlap, add profit, and remove from array
    if(i === 1 && (current[0] >= previous[1])) {
      maxProfit += previous[2]
      jobs.shift()
    }
    //job in the middle of array doesn't have overlap, add profit, and remove from array
    if(next && (current[0] >= previous[1]) && (current[1] <= next[0])) {
      maxProfit += current[2]
      // jobs.splice(i, 1)
      // i--
    }
    
    //job at end of array doesn't have overlap, add profit, and remove from array
    if(jobs.length === i + 1 && current[0] >= previous[1]) {
       maxProfit += current[2] 
      jobs.pop()
    }
  
  }
  // console.log(jobs)
  
  //then handle overlap
    // console.log(maxProfit)
    // return jobs
};

jobScheduling ([1,2,3,3], [3,4,5,6], [50,10,40,70])//120, The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70. 
jobScheduling ([1,2,3,4,6],[3,5,10,6,9], [20,20,100,70,60])//150, The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
jobScheduling ([1,1,1], [2,3,4], [5,6,4])//6

## DP Suggested Solution

    let jobs = [];
    let n = startTime.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        jobs.push({s: startTime[i], e: endTime[i], p: profit[i]});
    }
    jobs.sort(function(x,y) {return x.e - y.e});
    let dp = new Array(n);
    dp[0] = jobs[0].p;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let profit = jobs[i].p;
        let task = -1;
        for (let j = i-1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (jobs[j].e <= jobs[i].s) {
                task = j;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (task != -1)
            profit += dp[task];
        dp[i] = Math.max(profit, dp[i-1]);
    }
    return dp[n-1];

## Time & Space Complexity

 
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N*logN)`, where `N` is the total number of jobs. This is due to the sorting that we did in the beginning. Also, while iterating the jobs, we might need to poll/offer jobs to the priority queue. Each of these operations can take `O(logN)`. Overall our algorithm will take `O(NlogN)`.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, which is required for sorting. Also, in the worst case, we have to insert all the jobs into the priority queue (when all jobs overlap) which will also take `O(N)` space. The overall space complexity of our algorithm is `O(N)`.
