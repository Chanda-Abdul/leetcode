# 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/
#
On a 2D plane, there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return <i>the <b>minimum time</b> in seconds to visit all the points in the order given</i> by `points`.

You can move according to these rules:
- In `1` second, you can either:
  - move vertically by one unit,
  - move horizontally by one unit, or
  - move diagonally `sqrt(2)` units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in `1` second).
- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
- You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.

### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/14/1626_example_1.PNG)

<b>Input:</b> `points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]`

<b>Output:</b> `7`

<b>Explanation:</b> 
`One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]`

`Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds`

`Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds`

`Total time = 7 seconds`.
### Example 2:
<b>Input:</b>  `arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]`

<b>Output:</b> `3`

<b>Explanation:</b> `1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.`.
### Example 3:
<b>Input:</b> `arr = [2,2,2,3,3]`

<b>Output:</b>  `-1`

<b>Explanation:</b> `There are no lucky numbers in the array.`.
### Example 4:
<b>Input:</b> `arr = [5]`

<b>Output:</b>  `-1`
### Example 5:
<b>Input:</b> `arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`

<b>Output:</b> `7`
## Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 500`

## My Solution
````
const minTimeToVisitAllPoints = function(points) {
    let seconds = 0;
    
    for(let i = 0; i < points.length-1; i++){
      //moves to get x-value to the next point
      let xMoves = Math.abs(points[i][0] -points[i+1][0]);
      //moves to get y-value to the next point
      let yMoves = Math.abs(points[i][1] -points[i+1][1]);
      //add the larger of the x or y value to total seconds
      seconds += Math.max(xMoves, yMoves)
    }
    
    //return total seconds
    return seconds;
};

minTimeToVisitAllPoints([[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]);//7
minTimeToVisitAllPoints([[3,2],[-2,2]]);//5
````

## Time Complexity
Linear time of `O(n)`
