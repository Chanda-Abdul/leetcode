# 1293. ðŸ”Ž Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in <b>one step</b>.

Return the <i>minimum number of <b>steps</b> to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)` given that you can eliminate <b>at most</b> `k` obstacles</i>. If it is not possible to find such walk return `-1`.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/short1-grid.jpg)
````js
Input: grid = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0],
  ], 
  k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10.
The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. 
Such path is 
  (0,0) -> 
  (0,1) -> 
  (0,2) -> 
  (1,2) -> 
  (2,2) -> 
  (3,2) -> 
  (4,2).

## Example 2:

````js
Input: grid = [
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0],
  ], 
  k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: We need to eliminate at least two obstacles to find such a walk.

## Constraints

- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m`, `n <= 40`
- `1 <= k <= m * n`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

### Complexity Analysis

Let `N` be the number of cells in the `grid`, and `K` be the quota to eliminate obstacles.
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> `O(Nâ‹…K)`
  - We conduct a <b>BFS traversal</b> in the `grid`. In the worst case, we will visit each cell in the `grid`. And for each cell, at most, it will be visited `K` times, with different quotas of obstacle elimination.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(Nâ‹…K)`.
- <b>Space Complexity:</b> `O(Nâ‹…K)`
  - We used a <b>queue</b> to maintain the order of visited states. In the worst case, the <b>queue</b> will contain the majority of the possible states that we need to visit, which in total is `Nâ‹…K` as we discussed in the <b>time complexity</b> analysis. Thus, the <b>space complexity</b> of the <b>queue</b> is `O(Nâ‹…K)1.
  - Other than the <b>queue</b>, we also used a set variable (named `visited`) to keep track of all the `visited` states along the way. Same as the <b>queue</b>, the <b>space complexity</b> of this set is also `O(Nâ‹…K)`.
  - To sum up, the overall <b>space complexity</b> of the algorithm is `O(Nâ‹…K)`.
