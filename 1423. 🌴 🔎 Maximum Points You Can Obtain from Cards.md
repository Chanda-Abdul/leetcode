# 1423. ðŸŒ´ ðŸ”Ž Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/
There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

> Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the maximum score you can obtain.


## Example 1:
```
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. 
However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. 
The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
```
## Example 3:
```
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
```
## Constraints

- `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

## Sliding Window Solution
```js
function maxScore(cardPoints, k) {
  //Sliding Window Approach
  let n = cardPoints.length;
  let pointsFromStart = [0];
  let pointsFromEnd = [0];
  let maxPoints = -Infinity;

  //create two arrays for possible sums from start and from end
  for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
    pointsFromStart.push(pointsFromStart[i - 1] + cardPoints[i - 1]);
    // console.log(pointsFromStart, pointsFromEnd)
  }
  for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
    pointsFromEnd.push(pointsFromEnd[i - 1] + cardPoints[n - i]);
  }

  // slide the two windows over the possibilities
  for (
    let windowStart = 0, windowEnd = pointsFromEnd.length - 1;
    windowStart <= k;
    windowStart++, windowEnd--
  ) {
    // console.log(pointsFromStart[windowStart], pointsFromEnd[windowEnd])
    maxPoints = Math.max(
      maxPoints,
      pointsFromStart[windowStart] + pointsFromEnd[windowEnd]
    );
    // console.log(pointsFromStart, pointsFromEnd)
  }

  return maxPoints;
}

maxScore((cardPoints = [100, 40, 17, 9, 73, 75]), (k = 3));
//248

maxScore(cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3)
// Output: 12
// Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. 
// However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. 
//The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

maxScore(cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2)
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

maxScore(cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7)
// Output: 55
// Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
```

### Complexity Analysis
Let `n` be the number of cards we need to select.

- <b>Time complexity</b>: `O(n)`. In the problem, we are iterating over the array of cards twice. So the <b>time complexity</b> will be `O(2â‹…n) = O(n)`.

- <b>Space complexity</b>: `O(1)` since no extra space is required.
