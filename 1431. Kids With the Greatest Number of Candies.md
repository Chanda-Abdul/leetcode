Given the array `candies` and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the <b>ith</b> kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that he or she can have the <b>greatest</b> number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the <b>greatest</b> number of candies.

 #
<b>Example 1:</b>

<b>Input:</b> `candies = [2,3,5,1,3]`, `extraCandies = 3`

<b>Output:</b> `[true,true,true,false,true]`

<b>Explanation: </b>

- Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
- Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
- Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
- Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
- Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 


<b>Example 2:</b>

<b>Input:</b> `candies = [4,2,1,1,2]`, `extraCandies = 1`

<b>Output:</b>  `[true,false,false,false,false]`

<b>Explanation: </b> 
- There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.


<b>Example 3:</b>

<b>Input:</b> `candies = [12,1,12]`, `extraCandies = 10`

<b>Output:</b>  `[true,false,true]`
 
 #
<b>Constraints: </b>

- `2 <= candies.length <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

#
<b>My Solution: </b>
```
var kidsWithCandies = function(candies, extraCandies) {
 var largest = Math.max.apply(Math, candies);
 let kidsWithExtra = [];
 for(i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
  kidsWithExtra.push((candies[i] + extraCandies)>=largest);
}
 return kidsWithExtra;   
}

kidsWithCandies([2,3,5,1,3], 3)
kidsWithCandies([4,2,1,1,2], 1)
kidsWithCandies([12,1,12], 10)
```
