# 1448. 👩🏽‍🦯 Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/

> Given a <b>binary tree</b> `root`, a node `X` in the tree is named <b>good</b> if in the path from `root` to `X` there are no nodes with a value greater than `X`.

Return the number of <b>good</b> nodes in the <b>binary tree</b>.


## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)
````js
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
````
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)
````js
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

````
## Example 3:
````js
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
````
 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the <b>binary tree</b> is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Solution
````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function goodNodes(root) {
  let goodOnes = 0;

  function goodNodesDFS(currNode, pathMax) {
    //base case
    if (!currNode) return;

    if (currNode.val >= pathMax) {
      goodOnes++;
      pathMax = currNode.val;
    }

    goodNodesDFS(currNode.left, pathMax);
    goodNodesDFS(currNode.right, pathMax);
  }

  goodNodesDFS(root, -Infinity);
  return goodOnes;
}

let root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(3);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(5);
goodNodes(root);
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
// Root Node (3) is always a good node.
// Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
// Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
// Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
goodNodes(root);
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

root = new TreeNode(1);
goodNodes(root);
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Root is considered as good.

## Complexity Analysis
Given `N` as the number of nodes in the tree,

- <b>Time complexity</b>: `O(N)`.  With <b>DFS</b> we visit every node exactly once and do a constant amount of work each time.
- <b>Space complexity</b>: `O(N)`.  Because <b>DFS</b> prioritizes depth, our call stack can be as large as the height `H` of the tree. In the worst case scenario, `H=N`, if the tree only has one path.
