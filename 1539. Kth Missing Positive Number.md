# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`.

Find the `kth` positive integer that is missing from this array.

## Example 1:
````
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
````
## Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 1000`
- `arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

## Solution 
````
function findKthPositive (arr, k) {
    let i = 0
    const n = arr.length
    
    while(i < n) {
        const j = arr[i] - 1
        if(arr[i] !== arr[j] && arr[i] > 0 && arr[i] <= n) {
            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]]
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    
    const missingNumbers = []
    const extraNumbers = new Set()
    
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(missingNumbers.length < k) {
            if(arr[i] !== i + 1) {
                missingNumbers.push(i + 1)
                extraNumbers.add(arr[i])
            }
        }
    }
    
    //add the remaining missing numbers
    let j = 1
    
    while(missingNumbers.length < k){
        const currentNumber = j + n
        
        //ignore if the array contains the current number
        if(!extraNumbers.has(currentNumber)) {
            missingNumbers.push(currentNumber)
        }
        j++
    }
    
    return missingNumbers[k-1]    
};

findKthPositive ([2,3,4,7,11], 5)//9, The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
findKthPositive ([1,2,3,4], 2)//6, The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
````
## Time & Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n + k)`, as the last two for loops will run for `O(n)` and `O(k)` times respectively.
- The algorithm needs `O(k)` space to store the `extraNumbers`.
