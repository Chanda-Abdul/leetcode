# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function `twoSum` should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where `index1` must be less than `index2`.

Note:

- Your returned answers (both `index1` and `index2`) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
 

### Example 1:
#### Input: 
`numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
#### Output: 
`[1,2]`
#### Explanation: 
The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
### Example 2:
#### Input: 
`numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6`
#### Output: 
`[1,3]`
### Example 3:
#### Input: 
`numbers = [-1,0], target = -1`
#### Output: 
`[1,2]`
 

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in increasing order.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

## My Solution 
```
const twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j < numbers.length; j++){
    if(j === i) {
      j++
    }
    if ((numbers[i]) + numbers[j] === target) {
      return [i+1, j+1]
      }
    } 
  }
}
```

### Input
```
twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9)
twoSum([2,3,4], 6)
twoSum([-1, 0], -1)
```

### Output
```
[ 1, 2 ]
[ 1, 3 ]
[ 1, 2 ]
```
