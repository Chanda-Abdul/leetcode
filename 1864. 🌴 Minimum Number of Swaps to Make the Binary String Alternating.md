# 1864. ðŸŒ´ Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-binary-string-alternating/

> Given a binary string `s`, return the minimum number of character swaps to make it alternating, or `-1` if it is impossible.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Any two characters may be swapped, even if they are not adjacent.

## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
The string is now alternating.
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.
```
## Example 3:
```
Input: s = "1110"
Output: -1
```
## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10001`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
```js
function minSwaps(s) {
  let ones = 0;
  let zeros = 0;
  let prev = '-1';

  //we use prev to hcek if the original string is
  //already alternating, if so we can immediately return 0 since we don't need to swap anything
  let alternating = true;

  for (const bit of s) {
    if (bit === '1') ++ones;
    else ++zeros;

    if (bit === prev) alternating = false;
    prev = bit;
  }

  if (alternating) return 0;

  if (Math.abs(ones - zeros) > 1) return -1;

  if (ones > zeros) return countSwaps(1);
  else if (zeros > ones) return countSwaps(0);

  return Math.min(countSwaps(0), countSwaps(1));

  function countSwaps(oneOrZero) {
    let swaps = 0;

    for (const bit of s) {
      if (oneOrZero != bit) ++swaps;

      oneOrZero ^= 1;
    }

    return swaps / 2;
  }
}

minSwaps(s = '111000');
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
// The string is now alternating
minSwaps((s = '010'));
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.

minSwaps((s = '1110'));
//Output: -1

```

## Complexity Analysis

- The <b>time complexity</b> of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in the given array. 
- The <b>space complexity</b> will be `O(1)`

## Fun Facts ðŸ¥³

- The <b>[increment operator `++`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment)</b> increments (adds one to) its operand and returns a value.
  - `++x` <b>pre-increment</b> means <i>"increment the variable; the value of the expression is the final value"</i>
  - `x++` <b>post-increment</b> means <i>"remember the original value, then increment the variable; the value of the expression is the original value"</i>
  
  Now when used as a standalone statement, they mean the same thing:
  ```js
  x++;
  ++x;
  ```
  The difference comes when you use the value of the expression elsewhere. For example:
  ```js
  x = 0;
  y = array[x++]; // This will get array[0]
  
  x = 0;
  y = array[++x]; // This will get array[1]
  ```
- The <b>[inequality operator `!=`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Inequality)</b>  checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a <b>Boolean</b> result. Unlike the <i>[strict inequality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_inequality)</i>, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.
- The <b>[bitwise XOR assignment operator `^=`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR_assignment)</b> uses the binary representation of both operands, does a <i>bitwise XOR operation</i> on them and assigns the result to the variable.
