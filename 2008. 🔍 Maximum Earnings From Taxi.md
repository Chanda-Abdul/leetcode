# 2008. üîç Maximum Earnings From Taxi
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-earnings-from-taxi/

There are `n` points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The `n` points on the road are labeled from `1 to n` in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point `1` to point `n` to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.

The passengers are represented by a <b>0-indexed 2D integer</b> array `rides`, where `rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi`] denotes the ith passenger requesting a ride from point `start[i]` to point `end[i]` who is willing to give a `tip[i]` dollar tip.

For each passenger `i` you pick up, you earn `end[i] - start[i] + tip[i]` dollars. You may only drive at most one passenger at a time.

Given `n` and `rides`, return the maximum number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.

<b>Note:</b> You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.

 

## Example 1:
````
Input: n = 5, rides = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: n = 20, rides = [[1,6,1],[3,10,2],[10,12,3],[11,12,2],[12,15,2],[13,18,1]]
Output: 20
Explanation: We will pick up the following passengers:
- Drive passenger 1 from point 3 to point 10 for a profit of 10 - 3 + 2 = 9 dollars.
- Drive passenger 2 from point 10 to point 12 for a profit of 12 - 10 + 3 = 5 dollars.
- Drive passenger 5 from point 13 to point 18 for a profit of 18 - 13 + 1 = 6 dollars.
We earn 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 dollars in total.
```` 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= rides.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `rides[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= starti < endi <= n`
- `1 <= tipi <= 10^5`

## Solution 
````js
function maxTaxiEarnings(n, rides) {
  //n => point on road, from 1 to n
  //rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi]

  const routeLength = rides.length;
  //sort on ride end
  rides = rides.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

  //create a dp array
  let dp = new Array(routeLength).fill(0);
  dp[0] = rides[0][1] - rides[0][0] + rides[0][2];

  for (let i = 1; i < routeLength; i++) {
    dp[i] = rides[i][1] - rides[i][0] + rides[i][2];
    let j = binarySearch(i);

    if (j !== -1) dp[i] += dp[j];

    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i - 1]);
  }

  //Search previous rides to find better ride option,
  //return -1 if there are none
  function binarySearch(idx) {
    let start = 0;
    let end = idx;

    while (start < end) {
      let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

      if (rides[mid][1] <= rides[idx][0]) {
        start = mid + 1;
      } else {
        end = mid;
      }
    }
    return end === 0 ? -1 : end - 1;
  }

  //max is in bottom right corner of dp
  return dp[routeLength - 1];
}

maxTaxiEarnings(5, [[2, 5, 4],[1, 5, 1],]);
//7
//We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.
maxTaxiEarnings(20, [[1, 6, 1],[3, 10, 2],[10, 12, 3],[11, 12, 2],[12, 15, 2],[13, 18, 1]]);
//20
//We will pick up the following passengers:
// - Drive passenger 1 from point 3 to point 10 for a profit of 10 - 3 + 2 = 9 dollars.
// - Drive passenger 2 from point 10 to point 12 for a profit of 12 - 10 + 3 = 5 dollars.
// - Drive passenger 5 from point 13 to point 18 for a profit of 18 - 13 + 1 = 6 dollars.
// We earn 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 dollars in total.
