# 2034. üîé Stock Price Fluctuation
https://leetcode.com/problems/stock-price-fluctuation/

‚ùó Heap solution offers better time/space complexity

‚ùó `maximum()` needs to be reviewed

You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. Each record contains a `timestamp` and the corresponding `price` of the stock at that `timestamp`.

Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, the records do not come in order. Even worse, some records may be incorrect. Another record with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream correcting the price of the previous wrong record.

<b>Design an algorithm that:</b>
- Updates the `price` of the stock at a particular `timestamp`, correcting the `price` from any previous records at the `timestamp`.
- Finds the latest `price` of the stock based on the current records. The latest `price` is the `price` at the latest `timestamp` recorded.
- Finds the maximum `price` the stock has been based on the current records.
Finds the minimum `price` the stock has been based on the current records.

<b>Implement the StockPrice class:</b>
- `StockPrice()` Initializes the object with no price records.
- `void update(int timestamp, int price)` Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp.
- `int current()` Returns the latest price of the stock.
- `int maximum()` Returns the maximum price of the stock.
- `int minimum()` Returns the minimum price of the stock.
 
## Constraints
- `1 <= timestamp, price <= 10^9`
- At most 10^5 calls will be made in total to `update`, `current`, `maximum`, and `minimum`.
- `current`, `maximum`, and `minimum` will be called only after `update` has been called at least once.


## Example 1:
#### Input
````
["StockPrice", "update", "update", "current", "maximum", "update", "maximum", "update", "minimum"]
[[], [1, 10], [2, 5], [], [], [1, 3], [], [4, 2], []]
````
#### Output
````
[null, null, null, 5, 10, null, 5, null, 2]
````
#### Explanation
````js
StockPrice stockPrice = new StockPrice();
stockPrice.update(1, 10); // Timestamps are [1] with corresponding prices [10].
stockPrice.update(2, 5);  // Timestamps are [1,2] with corresponding prices [10,5].
stockPrice.current();     // return 5, the latest timestamp is 2 with the price being 5.
stockPrice.maximum();     // return 10, the maximum price is 10 at timestamp 1.
stockPrice.update(1, 3);  // The previous timestamp 1 had the wrong price, so it is updated to 3.
                          // Timestamps are [1,2] with corresponding prices [3,5].
stockPrice.maximum();     // return 5, the maximum price is 5 after the correction.
stockPrice.update(4, 2);  // Timestamps are [1,2,4] with corresponding prices [3,5,2].
stockPrice.minimum();     // return 2, the minimum price is 2 at timestamp 4.

## Complexity Analysis
<!-- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N*logN)`, where `‚ÄòN‚Äô` is the total number of meetings. This is due to the sorting that we did in the beginning. Also, while iterating the meetings we might need to poll/offer meeting to the priority queue. Each of these operations can take `O(logN)`. Overall our algorithm will take `O(NlogN)`. -->
<!-- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for sorting. Also, in the worst case scenario, we‚Äôll have to insert all the meetings into the Min Heap (when all meetings overlap) which will also take `O(N)` space. The overall space complexity of our algorithm is `O(N)`. -->
