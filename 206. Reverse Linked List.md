#### Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:
  Input: `1->2->3->4->5->NULL`
  
  Output: `5->4->3->2->1->NULL`
  
Follow up:
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

#
##### 
Iteratively

```
var reverseList = function(head) {
    previous = null
    current = head
  
  while (current !== null) {
    next = current.next
    current.next = previous
    previous = current
    current = next
  }
  return previous
}
```
