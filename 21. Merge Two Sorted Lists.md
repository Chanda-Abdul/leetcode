# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

#### Input: `l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]`
#### Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`
### Example 2:
#### Input: `l1 = [], l2 = []`
#### Output: `[]`
### Example 3:
#### Input: `l1 = [], l2 = [0]`
#### Output: `[0]`
 

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# My solution 
````
const mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    const result = new ListNode(-1)
    let curr = result
    while (l1 && l2) {
        if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            curr.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        } else {
            curr.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        }
        curr = curr.next
    }
    curr.next = l1 || l2
    return result.next
    
};
