# 2128. ðŸ”Ž Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-ones-with-row-and-column-flips/

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix grid.

In one operation, you can choose any `row` or `column` and flip each value in that `row` or `column` (i.e., changing all `0`'s to `1`'s, and all `1`'s to `0`'s).

Return `true` if it is possible to remove all `1`'s from grid using any number of operations or `false` otherwise.


## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/03/image-20220103191300-1.png)
````
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: One possible way to remove all 1's from grid is to:
- Flip the middle row
- Flip the middle column

## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/03/image-20220103181204-7.png)
````
Input: grid = [[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to remove all 1's from grid.
````
## Example 3:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/03/image-20220103181224-8.png)
````
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are no 1's in grid.
````

## Constraints:
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m`, `n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solution 
````js
function removeOnes(grid) {
  //every row should be complementary to first row
  //or else there will always be an extra value

  const rows = grid.length;
  const columns = grid[0].length;

  //if the matrix only has one row then it is always true
  if (rows <= 1) return true;

  const firstRow = grid[0];

  //start with the second row
  //compare all values to the first row
  for (let i = 1; i < rows; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
      //IF first element of rows are the same
      if (grid[i][0] === firstRow[0]) {
        //THEN every other element should be the same too
        if (grid[i][j] !== firstRow[j]) return false;
      } else {
        //Otherwise, every element should be complementary
        if (grid[i][j] !== 1 - firstRow[j]) return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}

removeOnes([
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0]]);
  //true
  //One possible way to remove all 1's from grid is to:
  //Flip the middle row
  //Flip the middle column
  
removeOnes([
  [1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]]);
  //false
  //It is impossible to remove all 1's from grid.
  
removeOnes([[0]]);
  //true
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- The Time Complexity of this alogrithm is `O(M Ã— N)`, where `M` is equivalent to the number of rows and `N` is equivalent to the number of columns
- This algorithm runs in constant space of `O(1)`
