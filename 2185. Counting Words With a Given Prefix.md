# 2185. Counting Words With a Given Prefix
https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-words-with-a-given-prefix/

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return the number of strings in `words` that contain `pref` as a <b>prefix</b>.

A <b>prefix</b> of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

## Example 1:
````
Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
- `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.
##  Solution
````
function prefixCount (words, pref) {
  let count = 0
  let n = pref.length
  
  for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    if(words[i].slice(0, n) === pref) count++
  }
  
  return count 
};

prefixCount (["pay","attention","practice","attend"], "at")
// 2, The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".

prefixCount (["leetcode","win","loops","success"], "code")
//0,There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
````

## Time and Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N + M)`
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`
