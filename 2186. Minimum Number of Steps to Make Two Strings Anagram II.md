# 2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram-ii/

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. In one step, you can append <b>any character</b> to either `s` or `t`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` and `t` <b>anagrams</b> of each other.

An <b>anagram</b> of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.
  
## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"
Output: 7
Explanation: 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".
"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "night", t = "thing"
Output: 0
Explanation: The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.
```` 
## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
````
function minSteps(s, t) {
  let sMap = new Map();
  let tMap = new Map();

  let short = s;
  let long = t;

  if (s.length >= t.length) {
    short = t;
    long = s;
  }

  let n = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < long.length; i++) {
    sMap.set(long[i], sMap.get(long[i]) + 1 || 1);
    n++
  }
  
  
  for (let j = 0; j < short.length; j++) {
    if (sMap.has(short[j])) {
      sMap.set(short[j], sMap.get(short[j]) - 1 || 0);
      n--
      if (sMap.get(short[j]) === 0) {
        sMap.delete(short[j]);
      }
    } 
    else {
      tMap.set(short[j], tMap.get(short[j]) + 1 || 1);
      n++
    }
  }

  return n
}

minSteps('v', 'u');

minSteps('leetcode', 'coats'); // 7
// Explanation:
// In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".
// In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".
// "leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
// We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
// It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.

minSteps ("night", "thing")//0,The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.

## Time and Space Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(M + N)`
- The algorithm uses `O(M + N)` space
