# ðŸ˜• 2195. Append K Integers With Minimal Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/append-k-integers-with-minimal-sum/

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Append `k` unique positive integers that do not appear in `nums` to `nums` such that the resulting total sum is minimum.

Return the sum of the `k` integers appended to `nums`.

 

## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [1,4,25,10,25], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The two unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 2 and 3.
The resulting sum of nums is 1 + 4 + 25 + 10 + 25 + 2 + 3 = 70, which is the minimum.
The sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [5,6], k = 6
Output: 25
Explanation: The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum. 
The sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.
````

## Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^9`

## Solution 
````
function minimalKSum(nums, k) {
  let sum = 0;
  nums = nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let n = 0;
  let i = 1;

  while (k > 0) {
    if (n < nums.length) {
      if (nums[n] === i) {
        n++;
        i++;
      }
      else {
        sum += i;
        i++;
        k--;
      }
    } else {
      sum += i;
      i++;
      k--;
    }
  }

  return sum;
}

minimalKSum([1, 4, 25, 10, 25], 2);
//5
//The two unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 2 and 3.
//The resulting sum of nums is 1 + 4 + 25 + 10 + 25 + 2 + 3 = 70, which is the minimum.
//The sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.

minimalKSum([5, 6], 6);
//25
//The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
//The resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum.
//The sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.
