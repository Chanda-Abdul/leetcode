## [2325. Decode the Message](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-message/description/)
- [ASCII Codes Table](https://ascii.cl/)
- [`String.fromCharCode()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode)


> You are given the strings `key` and `message`, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode message are as follows:
> 
> 1. Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the order of the substitution table.
> 2. Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
> 3. Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
> 4. Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
> 
> For example, given `key = "happy boy"` (actual `key` would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of
> `('h' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'b', 'p' -> 'c', 'y' -> 'd', 'b' -> 'e', 'o' -> 'f')`.
>
> Return the decoded message.

## Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/08/ex1new4.jpg)
```
Input:
  key = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
  message = "vkbs bs t suepuv"

Output:
  "this is a secret"

Explanation:
  The diagram above shows the substitution table.
  It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in
  "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
```
## Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/08/ex2new.jpg)
```
Input:
  key = "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo",
  message = "zwx hnfx lqantp mnoeius ycgk vcnjrdb"

Output:
  "the five boxing wizards jump quickly"

Explanation:
  The diagram above shows the substitution table.
  It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo".
```

## Constraints:

- `26 <= key.length <= 2000`
- `key` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '`.
- `key` contains every letter in the English alphabet (`'a'` to `'z'`) at least once.
- `1 <= message.length <= 2000`
- `message` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '`.

## Solution 

```ts
function decodeMessage(key, message) {
  // Create map to store the substitution mappings.
  // The keys of the map will be the characters from the key string,
  // and the values will be the corresponding letters of the alphabet.
  let myMap = new Map();

  // keep track of the current position in the alphabet
  let idx = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
    if (!myMap.has(key[i]) && key[i] !== ' ') {
      // the character from key is added to the map,
      // and its corresponding lowercase letter is generated
      // using the ASCII code and added as the value.
      myMap.set(key[i], String.fromCharCode(idx + 97));

      // increment to move to the next letter in the alphabet.
      idx++;
    }
  }

  // to store the decoded message.
  let decoded = '';

  for (let j = 0; j < message.length; j++) {
    if (message[j] === ' ') {
      decoded += ' ';
    } else {
      // corresponding substitution from the myMap is retrieved
      // using and appended to the decoded string.
      decoded += myMap.get(message[j]);
    }
  }
  return decoded;
}

decodeMessage(
  'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog',
  'vkbs bs t suepuv'
);
// 'this is a secret'

decodeMessage(
  'eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo',
  'zwx hnfx lqantp mnoeius ycgk vcnjrdb'
);
// 'the five boxing wizards jump quickly'

```


## Time & Space Complexity

- Time complexity is `O(n)`.
- Space complexity `O(1)` .
