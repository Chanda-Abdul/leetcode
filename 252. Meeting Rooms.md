Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1, e1], [s2, e2], ...]` (si < ei) determine if a person could attend all meetings.

### Example 1:

#### Input: `[[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]`
#### Output: `false`

### Example 2:

#### Input: `[[7, 10], [2, 4]]`
#### Output: `true` 

### My Solution
````
function canAttendMeetings(intervals) {
  //if there are <= 1 meetings,
  //then there should no be any scheduling conflicts
  if(intervals.length <= 1) {
    return true
  }
  
  //sort the interval array
  intervals = intervals.sort((a, b) => {
    return a[0] - b[0]
  })
  
  //keep track of endtimes
  let meetingEnd = intervals[0][1]
  
  //check for overlap
  for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    if(meetingEnd > intervals[i][0]) {
      return false
    }
    if(meetingEnd < intervals[i][1]) {
      meetingEnd = intervals[i][1]
    }
  }
    return true
};

canAttendMeetings([[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]])//false
canAttendMeetings([[7,10],[2,4]])//true

## Pramp Question and Solution

### Time Planner
Implement a function `meetingPlanner` that given the availability, `slotsA` and `slotsB`, of two people and a meeting duration `dur`, returns the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration `dur`. If there is no common time slot that satisfies the duration requirement, return an empty array.

Time is given in a Unix format called Epoch, which is a nonnegative integer holding the number of seconds that have elapsed since `00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970`.

Each person’s availability is represented by an array of pairs. Each pair is an epoch array of size two. The first epoch in a pair represents the start time of a slot. The second epoch is the end time of that slot. The input variable `dur` is a positive integer that represents the duration of a meeting in seconds. The output is also a pair represented by an epoch array of size two.

In your implementation assume that the time slots in a person’s availability are disjointed, i.e, time slots in a person’s availability don’t overlap. Further assume that the slots are sorted by slots’ start time.

Implement an efficient solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

#### Examples:

#### input:  
```     
slotsA = [[10, 50], [60, 120], [140, 210]]
slotsB = [[0, 15], [60, 70]]
dur = 8
```
#### output: 
`[60, 68]`

#### input:  
```
slotsA = [[10, 50], [60, 120], [140, 210]]
slotsB = [[0, 15], [60, 70]]
dur = 12
```
#### output: 
`[]`
* since there is no common slot whose duration is 12

### Constraints:
- `[time limit] 5000ms`
- [input] array.array.integer `slotsA`
  - `1 ≤ slotsA.length ≤ 100`
  - `slotsA[i].length = 2`
- [input] array.array.integer `slotsB`
  - 1 ≤ slotsB.length ≤ 100
  - slotsB[i].length = 2
- [input] integer
- [output] array.integer

### Solution 

````
function meetingPlanner(slotsA, slotsB, dur) {
 //arrays are sorted already

  //then find overlap time, check each overlap to see if the duration fits within the time slot

  let a = 0
  let b = 0
  
  while(a < slotsA.length && b < slotsB.length) {
    let start = Math.max(slotsA[a][0], slotsB[b][0])
    //10 0 => 10
    //10 60 => 60
    //60 60 => 60
    let end = Math.min(slotsA[a][1], slotsB[b][1])
    //50 15 => 15
    //50 70 => 50
    //120 120 => 120
   
    if(start + dur <= end) { 
      //10 + 8 !<= 15
      //60 + 8 !<= 50
      //60 + 8 <= 120
      return [start, start + dur]
      //[ 60, 68 ]
    }
    
    if(slotsA[a][1] < slotsB[b][1]) { 
      //50 !< 15
      //50 < 120 => a = 1
      a++
    } else {
      b++ 
      //b = 1
    }
    
  }
  return []
}

// meetingPlanner(
//   [[10, 50], [60, 120], [140, 210]], 
//   [[0, 15], [60, 70]], 
//   8)

//time O(n log n)

//space O (n)

## Interview Cake Question and Solution

Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.

To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as objects with integer properties startTime and endTime. These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

For example:
```
{ startTime: 2, endTime: 3 }  // meeting from 10:00 – 10:30 am
{ startTime: 6, endTime: 9 }  // meeting from 12:00 – 1:30 pm
```

Write a function `mergeRanges()` that takes an array of multiple meeting time ranges and returns an array of condensed ranges.

For example, given:
```
  [
  { startTime: 0,  endTime: 1 },
  { startTime: 3,  endTime: 5 },
  { startTime: 4,  endTime: 8 },
  { startTime: 10, endTime: 12 },
  { startTime: 9,  endTime: 10 },
]
```
your function would return:
```
  [
  { startTime: 0, endTime: 1 },
  { startTime: 3, endTime: 8 },
  { startTime: 9, endTime: 12 },
]
```

### My Solution
````
function mergeRanges(meetings) {
  //create a deep copy of the meetings array
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign#Deep_Clone
  const meetingsCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(meetings))
  
  // sort by start time
  const sortedMeetings = meetingsCopy.sort((a, b) => {
    return a.startTime - b.startTime
  })
  
  //Initialize mergedMeetings with the earliest meeting
  const mergedMeetings = [sortedMeetings[0]]
  
  for(let i=1; i < sortedMeetings.length; i++) {
    const currentMeeting = sortedMeetings[i];
    const lastMergedMeeting = mergedMeetings[mergedMeetings.length -1]
    
    //if the current meeting overlaps with the last merged meeting, 
    // use the later end time of the two
    if(currentMeeting.startTime <= lastMergedMeeting.endTime) {
      lastMergedMeeting.endTime = Math.max(lastMergedMeeting.endTime, currentMeeting.endTime)
    } else {
      //add the current meeting since it does not overlap
      mergedMeetings.push(currentMeeting)
    }
  }
  
  return mergedMeetings;
}

mergeRanges([
  { startTime: 0, endTime: 1 },
  { startTime: 3, endTime: 5 },
  { startTime: 4, endTime: 8 },
  { startTime: 10, endTime: 12 },
  { startTime: 9, endTime: 10 },
]);
