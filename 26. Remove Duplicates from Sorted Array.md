##### Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates <b>in-place such</b> that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
##### Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

#

#### Example 1:

Given `nums = [1,1,2]`,

Your function should return `length = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `1` and `2` respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

#### Example 2:

Given `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`,

Your function should return `length = 5`, with the first five elements of nums being modified to `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

#

#### Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

````
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
````
# 
### My Solution


````
//return length of new array with duplicates removed
//sort array, in-place
  // return nums.sort()
//start at beginning of array
//check each number to see if it is identical to the previous number, if so remove that number from the array
//create a variable to store the number of unique elements in the array
````
```
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
if(nums.length == 0) return 0
let uniqueItems = 0;
for(i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  if(nums[i] !== nums[i + 1]) {
    uniqueItems++
    }
  }
return uniqueItems   
};

nums0 = []
nums1 = [1,1,2]
nums2 = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

removeDuplicates(nums0)
removeDuplicates(nums1)
removeDuplicates(nums2)
```
