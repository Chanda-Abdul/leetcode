# 344. Reverse String(Strings)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

#


Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
 #
#### Example 1:

Input: `["h","e","l","l","o"]`

Output: `["o","l","l","e","h"]`
#### Example 2:

Input: `["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`

Output: `["h","a","n","n","a","H"]`

## My Solution
```
const reverseString = function(s) {
//which data structure to use
//two-pointer approach
let last = s.length -1
for(let i = 0; i < s.length/2; i++) {
  let temp = s[i];
  s[i] = s[last];
  s[last] = temp;
  last--;
}

return s;
};
```

## Time Complexity

Linear time of `O(n)`
