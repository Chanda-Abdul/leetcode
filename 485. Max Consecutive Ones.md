# 485. Max Consecutive Ones
https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

## Example 1:
#### Input: `[1,1,0,1,1,1]`
#### Output: `3`
#### Explanation: 
    The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
## Note:
- The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
- The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

## My Solution
````
function findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums) {
    let max = 0
    let curr = 0
    for(let k of nums) {
      max = Math.max(max, curr += k)
      if(!k) curr = 0
    }
    return max
};

findMaxConsecutiveOnes([1,1,0,1,1,1])
