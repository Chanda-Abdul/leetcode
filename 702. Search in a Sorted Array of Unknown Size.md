# 702. Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/

This is an <b>interactive problem</b>.

You have a sorted array of unique elements and an unknown size. You do not have an access to the array but you can use the `ArrayReader` interface to access it. You can call `ArrayReader.get(i)` that:

- returns the value at the `ith` index <b>(0-indexed)</b> of the `secret` array (i.e., `secret[i]`), or
- returns `2^31 - 1` if the `i` is out of the boundary of the array.

You are also given an integer `target`.

Return the index `k` of the hidden array where `secret[k] == target` or return `-1` otherwise.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

## Example 1:
````
Input: secret = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in secret and its index is 4.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: secret = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in secret so return -1.
```` 

## Constraints:

- `1 <= secret.length <= 104`
- `-10^4 <= secret[i], target <= 10^4`
- `secret` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

## Solution
````
function search (reader, target) {
    if(reader.get(0) === 0) return 0
    //1. find the proper bounds
    let start = 0
    let end = 1
    
    while(reader.get(end) < target) {
        let newStart = end + 1
        end += (end - start + 1) * 2
        
        //2. Increase to double the bounds size
        start = newStart
    }
    
    return binarySearch(start, end, reader, target)
};

function binarySearch(start, end, reader, target) {
    while(start <= end) {
        let mid = Math.floor(start +(end -start)/2)
        
        if(target < reader.get(mid)) {
            end = mid -1
        } else if( target > reader.get(mid)) {
            start = mid + 1
        } else {
            return mid
        }
    }
    return -1    
}
````

## Time & Space Complexity
- There are two parts of the algorithm. In the first part, we keep increasing the boundâ€™s size exponentially (double it every time) while searching for the proper bounds. Therefore, this step will take `O(log N)` assuming that the array will have maximum `N` numbers. In the second step, we perform the binary search which will take `O(log N)`, so the overall time complexity of our algorithm will be` O(log N + log N)` which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(log N)`.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
