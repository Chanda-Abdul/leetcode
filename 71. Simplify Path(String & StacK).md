# 71. Simplify Path
https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/
#
Given a string `path`, which is an <b>absolute path</b> (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified <b>canonical path</b>.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The <b>canonical path</b> should have the following format:
- The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
- The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return the simplified <b>canonical path</b>.

## Example 1:
<b>Input:</b> `path = "/home/"`

<b>Output:</b> `"/home"`

<b>Explanation:</b> `Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.`

## Example 2:
<b>Input:</b> `path = "/../"`

<b>Output:</b> `"/"`

<b>Explanation:</b> `Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.`
## Example 3:
<b>Input:</b> `path = "/home//foo/"`

<b>Output:</b> `"/home/foo"`

<b>Explanation:</b> `In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.`
## Example 4:
<b>Input:</b> `path = "/a/./b/../../c/"`

<b>Output:</b> `"/c"`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
- `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

## My Solution
````
const simplifyPath = function(path) {
   // implement a stack
  let stack = [];
  path = path.split('/')
  for(let i = 0; i< path.length; i++) {
    if(path[i]=='.' || path[i]=="") {
      continue
    }
    if(path[i]==".."){
      stack.pop();
    }
    else stack.push(path[i])
  }
  return `/${stack.join('/')}`;
};

simplifyPath("/home/")//"/home"
simplifyPath("/../")//"/"
simplifyPath("/home//foo/")//"/home/foo"
simplifyPath("/a/./b/../../c/") //"/c"
````

## Time Complexity
Linear time of `O(n)`
