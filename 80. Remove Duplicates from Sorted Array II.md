# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
#TwoPointers #Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

<b>Clarification</b>:

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:

````
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. 
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. 
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
````
## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## My Solution
````
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    
    let index = 0
    let counter = 1
    
   for( let i = 1;i< nums.length; i++) {
    
       if(nums[i] == nums[index]) counter++
       
       else counter = 1
       
       if(counter <= 2) index++
       
       nums[index] = nums[i]
         
    }
    
    return index + 1
    
};
````

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in the given array.

### Space Complexity

The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
