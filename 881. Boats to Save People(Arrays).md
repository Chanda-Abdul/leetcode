# 881. Boats to Save People
https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/
#
You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an <b>infinite number of boats</b> where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

<i>Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.</i>

## Example 1:
<b>Input:</b> `people = [1,2], limit = 3`

<b>Output:</b> `1`

<b>Explanation:</b> `1 boat (1, 2)`

## Example 2:
<b>Input:</b> `people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3`

<b>Output:</b> `3`

<b>Explanation:</b> `3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)`
## Example 3:
<b>Input:</b> `people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5`

<b>Output:</b> `4`

<b>Explanation:</b> `4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)`


## Constraints:
- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10^4`

## My Solution
````
const numRescueBoats = function(people, limit) {
    //sort the input
    people.sort((a, b) => b - a)
    
    //two-pointers
    let lastPerson = people.length
    let firstPerson = 0;
    
    while(firstPerson < lastPerson) { 
        if (people[firstPerson] + people[lastPerson - 1] <= limit) {
            lastPerson--
        }
      firstPerson++
    }
    return firstPerson
};

numRescueBoats([1,2], 3)//1
numRescueBoats([3,2,2,1], 3)//3
numRescueBoats([3,5,3,4], 5)//4
````

## Time Complexity
Linear time of `O(n)`
