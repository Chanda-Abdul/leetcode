# ❌ 300. 👩🏽‍🦯 Longest Increasing Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/
> Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

 


## Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
````
## Example 3:
````
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
````


## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
 

## Solution 



````js

````
### Complexity Analysis

Assume, `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- <b>Time Complexity:</b> 

- <b>Space Complexity:</b> 
## Follow up
- [ ] Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
