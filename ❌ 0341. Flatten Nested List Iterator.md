# 341. ‚ùå Flatten Nested List Iterator
https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-nested-list-iterator/

You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the `NestedIterator` class:
- `NestedIterator(nestedList)` Initializes the iterator with the nested list `nestedList`.
- `next()` Returns the next integer in the nested list.
- `hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.

Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:
```
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []
while iterator.hasNext()
    append iterator.next() to the end of res
return res
```
If `res` matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.


## Example 1:
````
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
````


## Constraints
- `1 <= nestedList.length <= 500`
- The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range `[-10^6, 10^6]`.
## Solution 



````js
class NestedIterator {
     constructor(nestedList) {
    this.gen = this.listGenerator(nestedList);
    this.nextVal = this.gen.next();
  }

  hasNext() {
    return !this.nextVal.done;
  }

  next() {
    const val = this.nextVal.value;
    this.nextVal = this.gen.next();
    return val;
  }

  *listGenerator(list) {
    for (const el of list) {
      if (el.isInteger()) yield el.getInteger();
      else yield* this.listGenerator(el.getList());
    }
  }
};

let nest = new NestedIterator([[1,1],2,[1,1]])
// let nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
