# 425. ❌ Word Squares
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-squares/
> Given an array of unique strings `words`, return all the word squares you can build from `words`. The same word from `word`s can be used multiple times. You can return the answer in any order.

A sequence of strings forms a valid word square if the `kth` row and column read the same string, where `0 <= k < max(numRows, numColumns)`.

For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.
 

## Example 1:
````
Input: words = ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output: [["ball","area","lead","lady"],["wall","area","lead","lady"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: words = ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
Output: [["baba","abat","baba","atal"],["baba","abat","baba","atan"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

## Constraints
- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 4`
- All `words[i]` have the same length.
- `words[i`] consists of only lowercase English letters.
- All `words[i]` are <b>unique</b>.

## Solution
