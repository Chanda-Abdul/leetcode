# 524. ❌ Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/

> Given a string `s` and a string array `dictionary`, return the longest string in the `dictionary` that can be formed by deleting some of the given string characters. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.


## Example 1:
````
Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
Output: "apple"
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["a","b","c"]
Output: "a"
````


## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 1000`
- `s` and `dictionary[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
## Solution 



````js

````
### Complexity Analysis

Assume, `n` is the length of the string `s`.
