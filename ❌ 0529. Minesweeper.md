Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!

You are given an `m x n` char matrix board representing the game board where:

- 'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
- 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
- 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
- 'X' represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array `click` where `click = [click[r], click[c]`] represents the next `click` position among all the unrevealed squares (`'M'` or `'E'`).

Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

- If a mine `'M'` is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to `'X'`.
- If an empty square `'E'` with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank `'B'` and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
- If an empty square `'E'` with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
Return the `board` when no more squares will be revealed.


## Example 1:
````
Input: board = 
  [["E","E","E","E","E"],
  ["E","E","M","E","E"],
  ["E","E","E","E","E"],
  ["E","E","E","E","E"]], 
click = [3,0]
Output: 
  [["B","1","E","1","B"],
  ["B","1","M","1","B"],
  ["B","1","1","1","B"],
  ["B","B","B","B","B"]]
````
## Example 2:
````
Input: board = 
  [["B","1","E","1","B"],
  ["B","1","M","1","B"],
  ["B","1","1","1","B"],
  ["B","B","B","B","B"]], 
click = [1,2]
Output: 
  [["B","1","E","1","B"],
  ["B","1","X","1","B"],
  ["B","1","1","1","B"],
  ["B","B","B","B","B"]]
````


## Constraints
- m == board.length
- n == board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- board[i][j] is either 'M', 'E', 'B', or a digit from '1' to '8'.
- click.length == 2
- 0 <= clickr < m
- 0 <= clickc < n
- board[clickr][clickc] is either 'M' or 'E'.
## Solution
