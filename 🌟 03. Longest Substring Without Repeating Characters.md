# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
#SlidingWindow #Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Given a string `s`, find the length of the <b>longest substring</b> without repeating characters.

## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
## Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
## Example 4:
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 ```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## My Solution
````
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
    //sliding window with hashMap
    let windowStart = 0, windowLength = 0, charIndexMap = {}
    
    //try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
    for(let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length; windowEnd++){
        const endChar = s[windowEnd]
        //if the map already contains the endChar, 
        //shrink the window from the beginning 
        //so that we only have on occurance of endChar
        if(endChar in charIndexMap) {
            //this is tricky; in the current window,
            //we will not have any endChar after
            //it's previous index. and if windowStart
            //is already ahead of the last index of
            //endChar, we'll keep windowStart
            windowStart = Math.max(windowStart, charIndexMap[endChar] +1)
            
        }
        //insert the endChar into the map
        charIndexMap[endChar] = windowEnd
        
        //remember the maximum length so far
        windowLength = Math.max(windowLength, windowEnd-windowStart+1)
    }
    
    return windowLength
};

- The above algorithm’s time complexity will be `O(N)`, where `‘N’` is the number of characters in the input string.
- The algorithm’s space complexity will be `O(K)`, where `K` is the number of distinct characters in the input string. This also means `K<=N`, because in the worst case, the whole string might not have any repeating character, so the entire string will be added to the HashMap. Having said that, since we can expect a fixed set of characters in the input string (e.g., 26 for English letters), we can say that the algorithm runs in fixed space `O(1)`; in this case, we can use a fixed-size array instead of the HashMap.
