You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version`) which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## Example 1:
<b>Input:</b> `n = 5, bad = 4`

<b>Output:</b> `4`

<b>Explanation:</b> 

`call isBadVersion(3) -> false`

`call isBadVersion(5) -> true`

`call isBadVersion(4) -> true`

`Then 4 is the first bad version.`

## Example 2:
<b>Input:</b> `n = 1, bad = 1`

<b>Output:</b> `1`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## My Solution
````
function solution(isBadVersion) {
  return function(n) {
   const left = 0;
  const right = n;
    
    while(right - left !== 1) {
      let mid = parseInt((left + right)/2);
      
      if(isBadVersion(mid)) {
        right = mid;
      } else {
        left = mid
      }
    }
    return right;
  }
}
````

## Time Complexity
Time complexity of `O(log(N))`
