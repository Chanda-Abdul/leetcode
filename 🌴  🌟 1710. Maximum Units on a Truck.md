# 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck ðŸŒ´ 
#Greedy #Sort

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i]` = `[numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:
- `numberOfBoxes``i` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBox``i` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.
- 
You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
## Example 1:

````
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:
- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
````

## Example 2:

````
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
Output: 91
````

## My Solution 


````
function maximumUnits (boxTypes, truckSize) {
    boxTypes.sort((a,b) => b[1] -a[1])
  
  let units = 0
  let currentBoxNum = 0
  
  for(const [boxes, boxUnits] of boxTypes) {
    if(truckSize === 0) return units
    
    const boxesToPlace = Math.min(truckSize, boxes)
    truckSize -= boxesToPlace
    units += (boxesToPlace * boxUnits)
  }
  return units
};

maximumUnits ([[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], 4)//8
maximumUnits ([[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], 10)//91
````

## Time Complexity
 The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in array `boxTypes`
 
 Sorting the array `boxTypes` of size `n` takes `nlogn` time. Post that, we iterate over each element in array `boxTypes` and in worst case, we might end up iterating over all the elements in the array. This gives us time complexity as `O(nlogn)+O(n)=O(nlogn)`.
 ## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm is `O(1)`, as we use constant extra space.
