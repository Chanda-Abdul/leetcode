You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array `sticks`, where `sticks[i]` is the length of the `ith` stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths `x` and `y` into one stick by paying a cost of `x + y`. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

## Example 1:

### Input: 
`sticks = [2,4,3]`
### Output: 
`14`
### Explanation: 
- You start with `sticks = [2,4,3]`.
- Combine sticks `2` and `3` for a `cost` of `2 + 3 = 5`. Now you have sticks = `[5,4]`.
- Combine sticks `5` and `4` for a cost of `5 + 4 = 9`. Now you have `sticks = [9]`.
- There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is `5 + 9 = 14`.
## Example 2:

### Input: 
`sticks = [1,8,3,5]`
### Output: 
`30`
### Explanation: 
- You start with `sticks = [1,8,3,5]`.
- Combine sticks `1` and `3` for a `cost` of `1 + 3 = 4`. Now you have `sticks = [4,8,5]`.
- Combine sticks `4` and `5` for a `cost` of `4 + 5 = 9`. Now you have `sticks = [9,8]`.
- Combine sticks `9` and `8` for a `cost` of `9 + 8 = 17`. Now you have `sticks = [17]`.
- There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total `cost` is `4 + 9 + 17 = 30`.
## Example 3:

### Input: 
`sticks = [5]`
### Output: 
`0`
### Explanation: 
There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is `0`.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= sticks.length <= 104`
- `1 <= sticks[i] <= 104`

## My Solution 
````
 //we want to minimize the cost === greedy solution
  let cost = 0
  if(sticks.length <= 1) return cost
  //sort
  sticks.sort((a, b) => a-b)  
  //minHeap
  //make heap
  let currentSticks = []
  while(sticks.length || currentSticks.length > 1) {
    let currSum = 0
    //we need sticks to combine so counter is 2
    let counter = 2
    while(counter--) {
      //if we have original stick an it is less than first currentSticks we will take the original
      const condition = sticks.length && (!currentSticks.length || (sticks[0] < currentSticks[0]))
      //add to curSum and remove first from either combined or original sticks array
      currSum += condition ? sticks.shift() : currentSticks.shift()
    }
    //add to result and add the stick that we combined to combined array
    cost += currSum
    currentSticks.push(currSum)
  }
  return cost
